<p><span class="smcap"><i>When</i></span><i> the original edition
of the</i> &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Great North
Road</span>&rdquo; <i>was published&mdash;in</i>
1901&mdash;<i>the motorcar was yet a new thing</i>.&nbsp; <i>It
had</i>, <i>in November</i>, 1896, <i>been given by Act of
Parliament the freedom of the roads</i>; <i>but</i>, <i>so
far</i>, <i>the character of the nation&rsquo;s traffic had been
comparatively little changed</i>.&nbsp; <i>People would still
turn and gaze</i>, <i>interested</i>, <i>at a
mechanically-propelled vehicle</i>; <i>and few were those folk
who had journeyed the entire distance between London and
Edinburgh in one of them</i>.&nbsp; <i>For motor-cars were
still</i>, <i>really</i>, <i>in more or less of an experimental
stage</i>; <i>and on any long journey you were never sure of
finishing by car what you had begun</i>.&nbsp; <i>Also</i>,
<i>the speed possible was not great enough to render such a long
</i><a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vi</span><i>journey exhilarating to modern ideas</i>.&nbsp; <i>It
is true that</i>, <i>the year before</i>, <i>the</i>
&ldquo;<i>Automobile Club of Great Britain and
Ireland</i>,&rdquo; <i>not yet become the</i> &ldquo;<i>Royal
Automobile Club</i>,&rdquo; <i>had in its now forgotten role of
a</i> &ldquo;<i>Society of Encouragement</i>&rdquo; <i>planned
and carried out a</i> &ldquo;<i>Thousand Miles Tour</i>,&rdquo;
<i>which had Edinburgh as its most northern point</i>; <i>but it
was a very special effort</i>.&nbsp; <i>Those who took part in it
are not likely to forget the occasion</i>.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>To-day</i>, <i>all that is changed</i>.&nbsp; <i>Every
summer</i>, <i>every autumn</i>, <i>sees large numbers of touring
automobiles on the way to Scotland and the moors</i>, <i>filled
with those who prefer the road</i>, <i>on such terms</i>, <i>to
the railway</i>.&nbsp; <i>From being something in the nature of a
lonely highway</i>, <i>the Great North Road has thus become a
very much travelled one</i>.&nbsp; <i>In this way</i>, <i>some of
its circumstances have changed remarkably</i>, <i>and old-time
comfortable wayside inns that seemed to have been ruined for all
time with the coming of railways and the passing of the coaches
have wakened to a newer life</i>.&nbsp; <i>Chief among these is
the</i> &ldquo;<i>Bell</i>&rdquo; <i>on Barnby Moor</i>, <i>just
north of Retford</i>.&nbsp; <i>The story of its revival is a
romance</i>.&nbsp; <i>Closed about</i> 1845, <i>and converted
into a farm-house</i>, <i>no one would have cared to predict its
revival as an inn</i>.&nbsp; <i>But as such it was reopened</i>,
<i>chiefly for the use of motorists</i>, <i>in</i> 1906, <i>and
there it is to-day</i>.</p>
<p><a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vii</span><i>But</i>, <i>apart from the tarred and asphalted
condition of the actual roadway in these times</i>, <i>the
route</i>, <i>all the way between London</i>, <i>York and
Edinburgh</i>, <i>looks much the same as it did</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Only</i>, <i>where perhaps one person might then know it
thoroughly</i>, <i>from end to end</i>, <i>a hundred are well
acquainted with the way and its features</i>.&nbsp; <i>It is for
those many who now know the Great North Road that this new
edition is prepared</i>, <i>giving the story of the long highway
between the two capitals</i>.</p>

<h2>I.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was once an American who,
with cheap wit, expressed a fear of travelling in the little
island of Great Britain, lest he should accidentally fall over
the edge of so small a place.&nbsp; It is quite evident that he
never travelled the road from London to York and Edinburgh.</p>
<p>You have to perform that journey to realise that this is,
after all, not so very small an island.&nbsp; It is not enough to
have been wafted between London and Edinburgh by express
train&mdash;even although the wafting itself takes seven hours
and a half&mdash;for one to gain a good idea of the
distance.&nbsp; We will not take into consideration the total
mileage between Dover and Cape Wrath, which tots up to the
formidable figure of eight hundred miles or so, but will confine
ourselves in these pages to the great road between London and
Edinburgh: to the Great North Road, in fact, which measures, by
way of York, three hundred and ninety-three miles.</p>
<p><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>There are
a North Road and a Great North Road.&nbsp; Like different forms
of religious belief, by which their several adherents all
devoutly hope to win to that one place where we all would be,
these two roads eventually lead to one goal, although they
approach it by independent ways.&nbsp; The North Road is the
oldest, based as it is partly on the old Roman Ermine Way which
led to Lincoln.&nbsp; It is measured from Shoreditch Church, and
goes by Kingsland to Tottenham and Enfield, and so by Waltham
Cross to Cheshunt, Ware, and Royston, eventually meeting the
Great North Road after passing through Caxton and climbing
Alconbury Hill, sixty-eight miles from London.</p>
<p>The Great North Road takes a very different route out of
London.&nbsp; It was measured from Hicks&rsquo;s Hall,
Smithfield, and, passing the &ldquo;Angel&rdquo; at Islington,
pursued a straight and continually ascending course for Holloway
and Highgate, going thence to Barnet, Hatfield, Welwyn,
Stevenage, Biggleswade, and Buckden to Alconbury; where, as just
remarked, the North Road merged into it.&nbsp; From London to
Hadley Green, just beyond Barnet, the Great North Road and the
Holyhead Road are identical.</p>
<p>In these volumes we shall consistently keep to the Great North
Road; starting, however, as the record-making cyclists of late
years have done, from the General Post-office in St.
Martin&rsquo;s-le-Grand, to or from which, or the neighbouring
old inns, the coaches of the historic past came and went.</p>
<p>We travel with a light heart: our forbears with dismal
forebodings, leaving duly-executed and attested wills behind
them.&nbsp; In the comparatively settled times of from a hundred
to two hundred years ago, they duly returned, after many days: in
earlier periods the home-coming was not so sure a thing.</p>
<p>These considerations serve to explain to the tourist and the
cyclist, who travel for the love of change and the desire for
beautiful scenery, why no one in the Middle Ages travelled from
choice.&nbsp; From the highest to the lowest, from the king in
his palace to <a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>the peasant in his wattled hut, every one who could do so
stayed at home, and only faced the roads from sheer
necessity.&nbsp; No one appreciated scenery in those days; nor
are our ancestors to be blamed for their shortcomings in this
respect, for outside every man&rsquo;s door lurked some danger or
another, and when a man&rsquo;s own fireside is the only safe
place he knows of, it is apt to appear to him the most beautiful
and the most desirable of spots.</p>
<p>We cannot say whether the Romans appreciated scenery.&nbsp; If
a love of the wildly beautiful in nature is dependent upon the
safety of those who behold it, and upon the ease with which those
scenes are visited, perhaps only the later generations of Roman
colonists could have possessed this sense.&nbsp; The earlier
Romans who made their splendid system of roads were, doubtless,
only military men, and, well aware of their dangers, found
nothing beautiful in mountain ranges.&nbsp; Their successors,
however, during four hundred years had leisure and plentiful
opportunities of cultivating taste, and travel was highly
organised among them.&nbsp; A milliare, or milestone, was placed
at every Roman mile&mdash;4854 English feet&mdash;and
&ldquo;mansiones,&rdquo; or posting-stations, at distances
varying from seven to twenty miles.</p>
<p>Roman roads were scientifically constructed.&nbsp; The
following was the formula:&mdash;</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><p style="text-align: right">I.</p>
</td>
<td><p>Pavimentum, or foundation.&nbsp; Fine earth, hard beaten
in.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p style="text-align: right">II.</p>
</td>
<td><p>Statumen, or bed of the road.&nbsp; Composed of large
stones, sometimes mixed with mortar.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p style="text-align: right">III.</p>
</td>
<td><p>Ruderatio.&nbsp; Small stones, well mixed with mortar.</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td><p style="text-align: right">IV.</p>
</td>
<td><p>Nucleus.&nbsp; Formed by mixing lime, chalk, pounded
brick, or tile; or gravel, sand, and lime mixed with clay.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p style="text-align: right">V.</p>
</td>
<td><p>Summum Dorsum.&nbsp; Surface of the paved road.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>So thoroughly well was the work done that remains of these
roads are even now discovered, in a perfect <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>condition,
although buried from six to fifteen feet, or even deeper, beneath
the present surface of the land, owing to the hundreds of years
of neglect which followed the abandonment of Britain, and the
decay of Roman civilisation; a neglect which allowed storms and
the gradual effects of the weather to accumulate deposits of
earth upon these paved ways until they were made to disappear as
effectually as Pompeii and Herculaneum under the hail of ashes
and lava that hid those cities from view for eighteen hundred
years.</p>
<p>When that great people, the Romans, perished off the face of
the earth, and none succeeded them, their roads began to decay,
their bridges and paved fords were broken down or carried away by
floods, and the rulers of the nation were for over five hundred
years too busily engaged in subduing rebellions at home or in
prosecuting wars abroad to attend to the keeping of
communications in proper repair.&nbsp; Social disorder, too,
destroyed roads and bridges that had survived natural decay and
the stress of the elements.&nbsp; Even those roads which existed
in otherwise good condition were only fair-weather
highways.&nbsp; They were innocent of culverts, and consequently
the storm-water, which nowadays is carried off beneath them,
swept across the surface, and either carried it away or remained
in vast lakes on whose shores wayfarers shivered until the floods
had abated.&nbsp; Thieves and murderers were the commonplaces of
the roads, and signposts were not; so that guides&mdash;who at
the best were expensive, and at the worst were the accomplices of
cutthroats, and lured the traveller to their haunts&mdash;were
absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>To the relief of travellers in those times came the Church,
for the civil and secular power had not begun even to dream of
road-making.&nbsp; The Church did some very important things for
travellers, praying for them, and adjuring the devout to include
them in their prayers for prisoners and captives, the sick, and
others in any way distressed.&nbsp; The very word
&ldquo;travel&rdquo; <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>derives from <i>travail</i>, meaning labour or
hardship.&nbsp; This alone shows how much to be pitied were those
whose business took them from their own firesides.</p>
<p>But to pray for them alone would not perhaps have been so very
admirable, and so the Church took the care of the roads on itself
in a very special sense.&nbsp; It granted indulgences to those
who by their gifts or their bodily labour helped to repair the
highways, and licensed hermits to receive tolls and alms from
travellers over roads and bridges constructed by the brethren,
those revenues going towards the upkeep of the ways.&nbsp;
Benefactors to the Church frequently left lands and houses, whose
proceeds were to be applied for the same purpose; and for many
years this trust was respected, and all the road and bridge
building and repairing was done by the religious.&nbsp; By
degrees, however, this trust was, if not betrayed, allowed to
gradually fall into neglect.&nbsp; False hermits set up in remote
places, away from the eyes of the bishops, and living idle and
dissolute lives on the alms they received, allowed roads and
bridges alike to fall into decay.&nbsp; These vicious, unlicensed
hermits were great stumbling-blocks to the godly in those
times.&nbsp; They were often peasants or workmen, who had
observed how fat and idle a living was that gained by those among
the licensed who had betrayed their trust and fared sumptuously
on alms unearned, and so went and set up in the eremitical
profession for themselves.&nbsp; They fared well on bacon, had
&ldquo;fat chekus,&rdquo; toasted themselves before roaring fires
in their too comfortable cells, and lived &ldquo;in ydelnesse and
ese,&rdquo; frequenting ale-houses and even worse places.&nbsp;
Accordingly many of them were eventually removed, or suffered
various punishments, and the neighbouring monasteries placed
others in their stead.</p>
<p>By this time, however, the bishops and abbots, whose broad
acres had often come to them in trust for the welfare of the
traveller, began to forget their obligations.&nbsp; It was, of
course, a natural process: the possessions of the religious
houses had grown <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>enormously, but so also had their hospitality to all and
sundry.&nbsp; Travellers had increased, and as it was a rule of
conduct with the great abbeys to not only relieve the poor, but
also to entertain the great in those days before the rise of the
roadside hostelry, their resources must have been well
exercised.&nbsp; Meanwhile the statutes of the country had
gradually been imposing the care of the roads upon the laity, and
at the time when the greater and lesser monasteries were
dissolved, in the reign of Henry the Eighth, parishes and
landowners were chiefly concerned in endeavouring to comply with
their new and strange obligations in keeping their ways
passable.&nbsp; Of course they did not succeed, and equally of
course, because it was impossible that they could, the pains and
penalties threatened for foul and dangerous roads were not
enforced.</p>
<p>A curious pamphlet on the condition of the roads in the
seventeenth century is that written by Thomas Mace, one of the
&ldquo;clerks&rdquo; of Trinity College, Cambridge, and published
in 1675.&nbsp; Mace, there is no doubt, was a man born out of his
time.&nbsp; Had circumstances been propitious, he might have
become another and an earlier Macadam.&nbsp; His pamphlet,
written both in prose and verse, and addressed to the king, is
styled <i>The Profit</i>, <i>Conveniency</i>, <i>and Pleasure for
the Whole Nation</i>, and is &ldquo;a Discourse lately presented
to His Majesty concerning the Highways of England; their badness,
the causes thereof, the reasons of these causes, the
impossibility of ever having them well mended according to the
old way of mending; but may most certainly be done, and for ever
so maintained (according to this New Way) substantially, and with
very much ease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We find here, as in other publications until the
mid-eighteenth century was well past, that the country was for
the most part unenclosed, so that when the traffic had worn the
old tracks into deep ruts, or when mud had rendered them
impassable, the wagons, carts, and laden horses were taken round
by the nearest firm spots.&nbsp; &ldquo;Much ground,&rdquo; says
our <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>author,
&ldquo;is now spoiled and trampled down in all wide roads, where
coaches and carts take liberty to pick and chuse for their best
advantages; besides, such sprawling and straggling of coaches and
carts utterly confound the road in all wide places, so that it is
not only unpleasurable, but extremely perplexing and cumbersome
both to themselves and to all horse travellers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These pickings and choosings were the original cause of the
still existing twists and turns in many of our roads.&nbsp; When
we see an old road winding snake-like through a flat country,
with no hills or other obvious reasons for its circuitous course,
we may, in most cases, safely attribute this apparent indecision
and infirmity of purpose to these ancient difficulties, thus
perpetuated.</p>
<p>This ancient state of things occasioned many disputes and even
fatal affrays between the packhorse men, who carried goods slung
across their horses&rsquo; backs from one part of the country to
the other, and between the market-folk and those who travelled on
horseback and coaches.&nbsp; Mace would himself seem to have
experienced some of these contentions as to who should take the
clean and who the muddy part of the road, for he writes with
great bitterness about &ldquo;these disturbances, daily committed
by uncivil, refractory, and rude, Russianlike rake-shames, in
contesting for the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hundreds of pack-horses,&rdquo; he continues,
&ldquo;panniers, whifflers, coaches, wagons, wains, carts, or
whatsoever others,&rdquo; fought and schemed for precedence; and
a horseman, his horse already exhausted by a long and tedious
journey, might, at the entrance to a town, especially on market
day, be compelled to go out of his way twenty times in one mile,
owing to the peevishness of these whifflers and
market-folk.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have often known many
travellers,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;and myself very often, to
have been necessitated to stand stock still behind a standing
cart or wagon, on most beastly and unsufferable wet wayes, to the
great <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>endangering of our horses and neglect of public business:
nor durst we adventure to stirr (for most imminent danger of
those deep rutts and unreasonable ridges) till it has pleased Mr.
Carter to jog on, which we have taken very kindly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His plan was to once get the roads in good repair, and then,
he says, with the employment of &ldquo;day men&rdquo; to every
five miles or so, they could be easily kept in order.&nbsp; The
prospect induces him to rise to poetry:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;First, let the ways be regularly brought<br
/>
To artificial form, and truly wrought;<br />
So that we can suppose them firmly mended,<br />
And in all needful points, the work well ended,<br />
That not a stone&rsquo;s amiss; but all complete,<br />
All lying smooth, round, firm, and wondrous neat.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So far good.&nbsp; But then comes the heavy traffic to destroy
the good work:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Then comes a gang of heavy-laden wains<br
/>
Of carts and wagons, spoiling all our pains.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But he is ready for this.&nbsp; His proposed &ldquo;day
men&rdquo; by at once filling up the ruts would make the damage
good.&nbsp; All these things he commends to the notice of his
Majesty with the concluding lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing yet worth
thinking on,<br />
Which is, to put this work in execution.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That it was <i>not</i> &ldquo;put into execution&rdquo; is a
matter of history.</p>
<p>We have seen that Mace calls the road to Scotland a
&ldquo;highway,&rdquo; and the terms &ldquo;highroad&rdquo; or
&ldquo;highway&rdquo; are common enough; but what really is a
highroad? or rather, how did the term originate?&nbsp; Such a
road is usually understood to be a main artery of traffic between
important towns, but that was not precisely the original meaning,
which indicated the physical character of the road rather than
its geographical status.&nbsp; &ldquo;High roads&rdquo; were
originally in fact, causeways constructed across, and above the
level of, marshes and low-lying lands, and the term <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>was therefore
excellently descriptive.&nbsp; The changed meaning no doubt arose
from the fact that, as it would scarcely ever have been worth
while to build embanked roads for the purpose of connecting
obscure villages out of the way of trade, consequently the
&ldquo;high ways&rdquo; and the &ldquo;high roads&rdquo; only
came into existence between important centres.&nbsp; But this
highly specialised meaning was destroyed when Turnpike Acts and
Highway Acts began to be passed.&nbsp; The first Turnpike Act,
one relating to the road to the North, referred to the
Shoreditch, Stamford Hill, Ware, and Royston route, which joined
the Great North Road at Alconbury Hill.&nbsp; It was passed in
1663, and authorised a toll-gate at Stilton, among other
places.&nbsp; In the preamble to this Act we find the road spoken
of as &ldquo;the ancient highway and post-road leading from
London to York and so into Scotland.&rdquo;&nbsp; Later Acts
providing for the collection of tolls on the main roads and for
the formation of Turnpike Trusts, whose business it was to
collect those tolls and with them keep the &ldquo;turnpike&rdquo;
roads in repair, named them &ldquo;turnpike roads&rdquo;; while
other legislation, culminating in the General Highway Act of
William the Fourth, perpetrated a delightful paradox by
especially designating by-roads &ldquo;highways.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
cardinal difference, in the eyes of the law, was that a turnpike
road was a main line of communication, to be maintained in proper
order throughout its length by taxes collected from the users of
the road; while highways were only local roads for local use and
to be maintained by the respective parishes in which they were
situated.&nbsp; The ways in which these parish roads were kept in
repair were sufficiently curious.&nbsp; &ldquo;Statute
labour&rdquo; preceded highway rates, and was so called from a
statute of Philip and Mary providing for parish road-surveyors,
and for men, horses, carts, and materials to be supplied by the
farmers at their orders, for repairs.&nbsp; &ldquo;Statute
labour&rdquo; survived in a fashion until the passing of the
General Highway Act of 1835, when it was wholly superseded by
rates.&nbsp; In later days parishes united <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>and formed
Highway Boards, just as they formed Poor Law Unions; and choosing
a surveyor, levied a common highway rate.&nbsp; These surveyors
were not always, nor often, competent men.&nbsp; They were, in
fact, generally elected by the Boards or the Vestries from some
necessitous inhabitants little above the status of the
broken-down old men who were paid a trifle to break or spread
stones in order to keep them from being burdens to the parish in
the workhouse.&nbsp; These surveyors were appointed and work done
in fear of the parishes being indicted and heavily fined for the
dangerous condition of their roads, but it is obvious that they
must have been very badly repaired in those times.&nbsp; Nowadays
the roads are all highways, since the turnpikes have been
abolished, and their repair, outside the boroughs, is the
business of the County Councils.</p>
<h2>II</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> Macadam and Telford appeared
upon the scene, the office of road-surveyor was very generally
looked down upon.&nbsp; No self-respecting engineer, before the
time of these great men, condescended to have anything to do with
roads.&nbsp; It is true that a forerunner of Macadam and Telford
had appeared in Yorkshire in 1765, when &ldquo;Blind Jack of
Knaresborough&rdquo; began the construction of the Boroughbridge
and Harrogate road, the first of the long series for which he
contracted; but he was not an official road-surveyor, nor by
profession an engineer.&nbsp; He was, in fact, an engineer born
and wholly untaught.</p>
<p>John Metcalf, the famous blind roadmaker, was born in 1717,
and lost his eyesight at six years of age.&nbsp; <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>A native of
Knaresborough, he filled in his time many parts; being fiddler,
huckster, soldier, carrier, proprietor of the first stage-wagon
between York and Knaresborough, and road and bridge maker and
contractor by turns.&nbsp; The marvellous instinct which served
him instead of sight is scarce credible, but is well
authenticated.&nbsp; He joined Thornton&rsquo;s company of
Yorkshire volunteers raised at Boroughbridge to meet the Scots
rebels in the &rsquo;45, and marched with them and played them
into action at Falkirk.&nbsp; His marvellous adventures have no
place here, but his solitary walk from London to Harrogate in
1741 concerns the Great North Road.&nbsp; Being in London, and
returning at the same time, Colonel Liddell of Harrogate offered
Blind Jack a seat behind his carriage, which Metcalf declined,
saying that he could easily walk as far in a day as the colonel
could go in his carriage with post-horses.&nbsp; This
incidentally shows us how utterly vile the roads were at the
time.&nbsp; Metcalf, although blind and unused to the road,
having travelled up to London by sea, walked back, and easily
reached Harrogate before the colonel, who posted all the way.</p>
<p>Liddell, who had an escort of sixteen mounted servants,
started an hour later than Metcalf.&nbsp; It had been arranged
that they should meet that night at Welwyn, but, a little beyond
Barnet, on Hadley Green, where the roads divide, Metcalf took the
left hand, or Holyhead, road by mistake and went a long distance
before he discovered his mistake.&nbsp; Still he arrived at
Welwyn first.&nbsp; The next day he was balked at Biggleswade by
the river, which was in flood, and with no bridge to cross
by.&nbsp; Fortunately, after wandering some distance along the
banks, he met a stranger who led the way across a plank
bridge.&nbsp; When they had crossed, Metcalf offered him some
pence for a glass of beer, which his guide declined, saying he
was welcome.&nbsp; Metcalf, however, pressed it upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, can you see very well?&rdquo; asked the
stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very well,&rdquo; replied Blind Jack.</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>&ldquo;God forbid I should tithe you,&rdquo; said his
guide.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am the rector of this parish; so God bless
you, and I wish you a good journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the end, Metcalf reached Harrogate two days before the
colonel.</p>
<p>Metcalf made many roads around Knaresborough and in different
parts of Yorkshire, but none actually on the Great North
Road.&nbsp; He died, aged ninety-three, in 1810, five years
before Macadam and Telford began their work upon the roads.&nbsp;
Like them, he rather preferred boggy ground for road-making, and
forestalled both them and Stephenson in adopting fagots as
foundations over mires.&nbsp; At that time the ignorant surveyors
of roads repaired them with dirt scraped from ditches and
water-courses, in which they embedded the first cartloads of
stones which came to hand; stone of all kinds and all
sizes.&nbsp; This done, their &ldquo;repairs&rdquo; were
completed, with the result that the roads were frequently as bad
as ever and constantly in the most rugged condition.&nbsp;
Roads&mdash;it may be news to the uninstructed&mdash;cannot be
made with dirt.&nbsp; In fact, a good road through anything but
rock is generally excavated, and the native earth being removed,
its place is taken by coarse-broken granite or rock; this in its
turn receiving a layer of &ldquo;macadam,&rdquo; or smaller
broken granite or whinstone, which is finally bound together by a
sprinkling of red gravel, of the kind known by builders as
&ldquo;hoggin,&rdquo; whose binding qualities are caused by a
slight natural admixture of clay.&nbsp; In his insistence upon
broken stones, Macadam proved a power of observation not
possessed by the generality of road-makers, whose method was the
haphazard one of strewing any kind upon the road and trusting in
the traffic to pack them.&nbsp; With rounded pebbles or gravel
stones thus chafing against one another, they never packed into a
solid mass, but remained for all time as unstable as a shingly
beach.&nbsp; Generations of road-making had not taught wisdom,
but Macadam perceived the readiness of the angularities in broken
stones to unite and form a homogeneous <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>mass, and in introducing his system
proved himself unwittingly a man of science, for science has in
these later days discovered that ice is compacted by the action
of ice-crystals uniting in exactly this manner.</p>
<p>A great scheme for laying out the whole of the Great North
Road between London and Edinburgh on a scientific basis was in
progress when the successful trial of the competing locomotives
at Rainhill, near Liverpool, cast a warning shadow over the
arrangements, and finally led to the project being entirely
abandoned.&nbsp; Had the work been done, it is quite possible
that the railways to the north would have taken another
direction; that, in fact, instead of land having to be surveyed
and purchased for them, the new, straight, and level road would
have been given up to and largely used by the railways.&nbsp;
Telford was the engineer chosen by the Government to execute this
work, of which the portion between Morpeth and Edinburgh was
actually constructed.&nbsp; The survey of the road between
London, York, and Morpeth was begun as early as 1825, and had
been not only completed, but the works on the eve of being
started, when the Rainhill trials in 1829 stopped them short, and
caused the utter waste of the public money spent in the
surveying.</p>
<h2>III</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> were vain, nowadays, to seek any
of the old starting-points from London.&nbsp; The late Mr.
Frederick Locker-Lampson asked in 1896, &ldquo;Are &lsquo;The
Bull and Mouth,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Spread Eagle,&rsquo; The Swan
with Two Necks,&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Green Man and Still,&rsquo;
yet in existence?&rdquo;&nbsp; With <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>some little research he would have
discovered that&mdash;with the sole exception of the
last-named&mdash;they are not.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Bull and
Mouth&rdquo; in later years became the &ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s
Hotel,&rdquo; and was demolished only when the site was required
for an extension of the General Post Office in 1887.&nbsp; At the
same time as the &ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s&rdquo; disappeared, the
street at the side of it, called from the old inn &ldquo;Bull and
Mouth Street,&rdquo; was stopped up.&nbsp; In this street was the
entrance to the famous old coaching-stables which were in the
last years of their existence used as a railway receiving-office
for goods.&nbsp; On their being pulled down, the grotesque
plaster sign, representing a giant face with yawning mouth in
which stood a bull, was removed to the Guildhall Museum, where it
may still be seen, together with the yet larger and more
elaborate sign which decorated the frontage of the
&ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; This also included a mouth and
a bull, set amidst a frame of plaster fruits and flowers, with
the inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Milo the Cretonian,<br />
An ox slew with his fist,<br />
And ate it up at one meal,<br />
Ye gods! what a glorious twist.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The origin, however, of the curious sign had nothing to do
with this hungry person.&nbsp; Precisely what was that origin is
never likely to be known; for although the legend that it derived
from the capture of &ldquo;Boulogne
Mouth&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> Boulogne Harbour&mdash;in the
reign of Henry the Eighth is in general acceptation, it has been
shrewdly suspected that this was a tale wickedly invented by
George Steevens, a literary practical joker, who palmed off many
similar stories upon unsuspecting antiquaries at the end of last
century.&nbsp; A perhaps more likely story is that the sign was
originally the &ldquo;Bowl and Mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under Sherman&rsquo;s rule the &ldquo;Bull and Mouth&rdquo;
became a mighty resort of coaches to and from all parts, but more
especially the north, and his <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>underground stables formed one of the
sights of London.</p>
<p>Edward Sherman was a man of many parts, and had a varied
career.&nbsp; Originally a stockbroker, he followed Willans at
the &ldquo;Bull and Mouth&rdquo; in 1823, and rebuilt it as the
&ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s&rdquo; in 1830, continuing the stables under
the old name, and eventually reconstructing them.&nbsp; The money
for these enterprises came from three old and wealthy ladies whom
he married in succession.&nbsp; If the stranger, unversed in the
build and colour of coaches, could not pick out the somewhat
old-fashioned, bright-yellow vehicles as Sherman&rsquo;s, he was
helped in identifying them by the pictorial sign of the inn
painted on the panels&mdash;rather a startling one, by the way,
to the rustics.&nbsp; Sherman, however, had not the prescience of
Chaplin or of Horne, who clearly foresaw the success of railways,
and he kept his coaches on the roads for some time after they
were opened to their destinations.&nbsp; He was sufficiently
ill-advised not to come to terms with the railway companies, and
actually attempted, with the &ldquo;Red Rover,&rdquo; to run the
Manchester trains off.&nbsp; Of course this could not last very
long, and Sherman withdrew after having lost seven thousand
pounds in a gallant, but futile, competition with steam.</p>
<p>In its prime the &ldquo;Bull and Mouth&rdquo; sent forth the
Edinburgh and Aberdeen Royal Mail by York; the Edinburgh,
Glasgow, and Aberdeen coach by Ferry-bridge to Newcastle, where
the Glasgow passengers changed; the Glasgow and Carlisle Royal
Mail; the Newcastle &ldquo;Wellington&rdquo;; Shrewsbury and
Holyhead &ldquo;Union&rdquo; and &ldquo;Oxonian&rdquo;;
Birmingham &ldquo;Old Post Coach&rdquo; and &ldquo;Aurora&rdquo;;
Leeds Royal Mail and &ldquo;Express&rdquo;; and Leicester
&ldquo;Union Post Coach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The site of the &ldquo;Swan with Two Necks&rdquo; is now
occupied by the London and North-Western and South-Western Joint
Goods Depot, in Gresham Street.&nbsp; Modern sculptured keystones
may be seen over the <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>entrances, bearing the effigy of a
double-headed swan.&nbsp; This sign, like that of the &ldquo;Bull
and Mouth,&rdquo; is a corruption of a widely different term;
originally, indeed, the &ldquo;Swan with Two Nicks,&rdquo; from
the particular &ldquo;nicks&rdquo; with which the bills of the
swans belonging to the Vintners&rsquo; Company on the Thames were
marked.&nbsp; The City Companies each had their swans on the
river, and even nowadays they are maintained on the upper
reaches.&nbsp; The young cygnets were marked at the annual
festival of &ldquo;swan-upping,&rdquo; at which the City magnates
used hugely to enjoy themselves.&nbsp; The old and the new
&ldquo;nicks&rdquo; of the Vintners&rsquo; Company are pictured
here.</p>

</a>So far back as 1556, the &ldquo;Swane with ij Nekes at Mylke
Street End&rdquo; was known, and was then the property of the
Vintners.&nbsp; In the coaching era it is best remembered as the
headquarters of the great William Chaplin&rsquo;s huge coaching
business.&nbsp; Chaplin succeeded William Waterhouse, who had
established himself here in 1792, issuing a curious token bearing
the representation of a mail-coach on one side and that of the
Double-Necked Swan on the other, with the legend, &ldquo;Speed,
Regularity, and Security.&nbsp; Payable at the Mail Coach Office,
Lad Lane, London, W.W.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lad Lane was until recent years the name by which this part of
Gresham Street was known, while the inn itself was generally
called by the coaching fraternity the &ldquo;Wonderful

<p>Chaplin had in early days been a coachman himself.&nbsp; His
career would have delighted that sturdy moralist, Hogarth,
painter of the successful career of the Industrious Apprentice,
for from that useful but humble position he rose to be the
largest coach-proprietor in England, Deputy-Chairman of the
London <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>and
Southampton (now London and South-Western) Railway, and Member of
Parliament for Salisbury.&nbsp; He is said to have accumulated
half a million of money.&nbsp; Twenty-seven mails left London
every night, and of these Chaplin horsed fourteen for various
distances.&nbsp; Very many stage-coaches were in his hands, and
at the height of the coaching era he is said to have owned nearly
two thousand horses.&nbsp; He was an entirely level-headed man,
and, seeing at an early stage that railways must succeed, threw
in his lot with them.&nbsp; Railway directors were exceedingly
anxious to win over the coaching proprietors, and to induce them
to withdraw from the road, so that with no coaches running the
public should of necessity, whether they liked it or not, be
compelled to travel by rail.&nbsp; Chaplin sold off his stock
before the oncoming railways depreciated it, and, joining
Benjamin Worthy Horne, of the &ldquo;Golden Cross,&rdquo; Charing
Cross, founded the great carrying firm of Chaplin and Horne,
which enjoyed the exclusive agency for the London and Birmingham
Railway.&nbsp; There can be little doubt, although it was <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>denied by the
early officials of that line, that Chaplin and Horne were really
bought off the road, and the sum of &pound;10,000 has been
mentioned as the price of their withdrawal.&nbsp; Before that
time had come, coaches issued from Chaplin&rsquo;s yard for many
places on the north-western roads: the Carlisle Royal Mail; the
Birmingham Royal Mail, &ldquo;Courier,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Balloon
Post Coach&rdquo;; the Chester &ldquo;New Coach&rdquo;; Coventry
&ldquo;Light Post Coach&rdquo;; Liverpool Royal Mail; Holyhead
&ldquo;New Mail&rdquo; and a stage-coach without any particular
name; and the Manchester Royal Mail, &ldquo;Defiance,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Regulator,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Prince
Saxe-Cobourg.&rdquo;&nbsp; The &ldquo;Spread Eagle&rdquo; in
Gracechurch Street has also disappeared.&nbsp; It was at one time
a house of Chaplin&rsquo;s, and was afterwards owned in
succession, together with the &ldquo;Cross Keys&rdquo; next door,
by Mrs. Nelson and Mrs. Mountain.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Green Man and Still,&rdquo; the last of the quartet
of inns inquired after by Mr. Locker-Lampson, is the only one now
standing, and may be seen at the corner of Oxford and Argyll
Streets, close by Oxford Circus.&nbsp; It was not a coaching
hostelry in the fullest sense, being only a place of call for the
Oxford &ldquo;Age,&rdquo; and for the Harrow and other
north-westerly &ldquo;short stages,&rdquo; running between London
and the suburbs.&nbsp; It is now a railway
receiving-office.&nbsp; This curious sign probably alludes to the
old profession of the &ldquo;herb-doctors,&rdquo; who distilled
medicines from wild or cultivated herbs.&nbsp; There were other
inns whence Great North Road coaches set out, but they have all
vanished.&nbsp; The &ldquo;George and Blue Boar,&rdquo; Holborn,
whence the famous &ldquo;Stamford Regent&rdquo; started, has long
since been pulled down, and the &ldquo;Inns of Court Hotel&rdquo;
stood on its site.&nbsp; The hotel building remains, but about
1912 it ceased to be a hotel, and has since been converted into
offices for an Insurance Company.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Regent&rdquo;
originally left London at six o&rsquo;clock in the evening, but
in 1822 the hour was altered to six in the morning, an unearthly
time for those who had to go some distance <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>to reach
Holborn, and necessitating, perhaps, getting up at three
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The announcement by the proprietors that
this alteration was for the &ldquo;more perfect
convenience&rdquo; of their patrons seems ironical:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span

<p>The &ldquo;Saracen&rsquo;s Head,&rdquo; Snow Hill, which must
not he confounded with the other and equally celebrated
&ldquo;Saracen&rsquo;s Head&rdquo; in Aldgate High Street, was
another very notable coaching establishment, and a galleried inn
of picturesqueness and antiquity.&nbsp; Alas! that it has long
since disappeared.&nbsp; Its history went back beyond the
fifteenth century, and a reference made to it in 1522, when the
suite of the Emperor Charles the Fifth lay here, speaks of the
house as of <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>some importance:&mdash;&ldquo;The signe of the Sersyns
hed: xxx beddes, a stable for xl horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sign, of course deriving from the Crusades, itself gives
the inn a very high antiquity.&nbsp; It was a sign of a gruesome
and savage aspect, and had its origin in the pictures the
returning Crusaders drew of their adversaries.&nbsp; As Selden
says:&mdash;&ldquo;Our countrymen pictured them with huge, big,
terrible faces, when in truth they were like other men.&nbsp; But
this,&rdquo; he adds slyly, &ldquo;they did for their own
credits.&rdquo;&nbsp; The inn owed its later celebrity to
Dickens, who made it the London inn of Mr. Squeers.&nbsp; Thus he
describes it:&mdash;&ldquo;Near to the jail, and by consequence
near to Smithfield, on that particular part of Snow Hill where
omnibus horses going eastward seriously think of falling down on
purpose, and where horses in hackney cabriolets going westward
not unfrequently fall by accident, is the coachyard of the
Saracen&rsquo;s Head Inn; its portal guarded by two
Saracens&rsquo; heads and shoulders frowning upon you from each
side of the gateway.&nbsp; The inn itself, garnished with another
Saracen&rsquo;s head, frowns upon you from the top of the
yard.&nbsp; When you walk up this yard you will see the
booking-office on your left and the tower of St.
Sepulchre&rsquo;s Church darting abruptly up into the sky on your
right, and a gallery of bedrooms upon both sides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a &ldquo;Saracen&rsquo;s Head&rdquo; on Snow Hill to
this day, but it is a modern building.&nbsp; From the old house
went the &ldquo;Lord Nelson,&rdquo; York, Newcastle, and
Edinburgh coach; the &ldquo;Post,&rdquo; despite its name, a
slow-coach, for Carlisle and Penrith, by Doncaster, Ferrybridge,
and Greta Bridge, doubtless the one by which Mr. Wackford Squeers
took his &ldquo;dear pupils&rdquo; to Dotheboys Hall; and coaches
to Hull, Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, and Shrewsbury,
besides others for the western roads.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Saracen&rsquo;s Head&rdquo; was kept by Mrs. Mountain, in
succession to her husband and her husband&rsquo;s father.&nbsp;
Her son, Peter, managed the business for her, but it must not be
supposed that she took no active part in it.&nbsp; To the <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>contrary,
Mrs. Sarah Ann Mountain, like her contemporary, Mrs. Nelson, of
the &ldquo;Bull,&rdquo; Aldgate, possessed the most brilliant
business capacity.&nbsp; She built coaches, as well as horsing
them, and earned a profit by charging her partners down the road
the mileage which in the usual course of business would have been
paid over to a coach-builder.&nbsp; There was no more expressive
sight in the London of the beginning of the nineteenth century
than the simultaneous starting of the mails every evening from
the General Post Office.&nbsp; Londoners and country-cousins
alike were never weary of the spectacle of the smart coaches, the
business-like coachmen, and the resplendent, scarlet-coated
guards preparing to travel through the night, north, south, east,
or west, with his Majesty&rsquo;s mails.&nbsp; Even the
passengers shone with a reflected glory, and felt important as,
one after the other, the twenty-seven mails began at the stroke
of eight o&rsquo;clock to move off from the double file that
lined the street.</p>

<p>That street was not the broad thoroughfare of St.
Martin&rsquo;s-le-Grand, but the narrow one of Lombard Street, in
which the General Post Office was situated for many years, until
1829, when what is now called the &ldquo;old&rdquo; General Post
Office, but was then the newly completed building of
Smirke&rsquo;s, was occupied.&nbsp; The old headquarters can
still be seen, in the Lombard Street Post Office of to-day.&nbsp;
It is from here that the picture of the mails starting, forming
the frontispiece of this volume, was taken.&nbsp; To our eyes,
accustomed to the crowded thoroughfare of modern times, the
street appears supremely dull and desolate, but that is only a
retrospective way of looking at it.</p>
<p>Here is a testimony to the beauty of the scene.&nbsp; It is
eloquent testimony, for it is De Quincey&rsquo;s:&mdash;&ldquo;On
any night the spectacle was beautiful.&nbsp; The absolute
perfection of all the appointments about the carriages and the
harness, their strength, their brilliant cleanliness, their
beautiful simplicity&mdash;but, more than all, the royal
magnificence of the horses&mdash;were what <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>might first
have fixed the attention.&nbsp; Every carriage, on every morning
of the year, was taken down to an official inspector for
examination&mdash;wheels, axles, linchpins, poles, glasses,
lamps, were all critically probed and tested.&nbsp; Every part of
every carriage had been cleaned, every horse had been groomed,
with as much rigour as if they belonged to a private gentleman;
and that part of the spectacle offered itself always. . . .&nbsp;
Every moment are shouted aloud by the post-office servants, and
summoned to draw up, the great ancestral names of cities known to
history through a thousand years&mdash;Lincoln, Winchester,
Portsmouth, Gloucester, Oxford, Bristol, Manchester, York,
Newcastle, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Perth, Stirling,
Aberdeen&mdash;expressing the grandeur of the empire by the
antiquity of its towns, and the grandeur of the mail
establishment by the diffusive radiation of its separate
missions.&nbsp; Every moment you hear the thunder of lids locked
down upon the mail-bags.&nbsp; That sound to each individual mail
is the signal for drawing off, which process is the finest part
of the entire spectacle.&nbsp; Then came the horses into
play.&nbsp; Horses!&nbsp; Can these be horses that bound off with
the action and gestures of leopards?&nbsp; What stir! what
sea-like ferment! what a thundering of wheels! what a trampling
of hoofs! what a sounding of trumpets!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>IV</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> for Post Office history.&nbsp;
Much has been made at the &ldquo;old&rdquo; General Post Office
in St. Martin&rsquo;s-le-Grand; and although the building was not
in existence until 1829, it has sent forth and received many
mail-coaches.&nbsp; Its disappearance in 1912, we say, therefore
severs the last link by which this busy quarter was connected
with the old days.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The story of the Post Office goes back long before the G.P.O.
was situated either here or at Lombard Street.&nbsp; The original
Post Office was off Eastcheap.&nbsp; <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>When it was there, the course of post
between London and Edinburgh took three days.&nbsp; The first
regular service was established in 1635, when Charles the First,
to end the inefficiency of the communications between the two
capitals, inaugurated &ldquo;a running post or two, to run night
and day, between Edinburgh and London, to go thither and come
back again in six days.&rdquo;&nbsp; We may suppose that this did
not work very well, for in 1649 we find the city of London
establishing a post of its own with a regular staff of runners
and postmasters between London and the North.</p>
<p>But with the Restoration came the establishment of the General
Post Office and an instantaneous decline in the efficiency of the
post, six days instead of three being taken for the single
journey to or from Edinburgh.&nbsp; This roused the towns on the
way to indignant protests, and the post was accelerated to
&ldquo;three and a half or four days,&rdquo; the acceleration
being slower than the original time.</p>
<p>But however keenly the intermediate towns may have felt this,
it could not have mattered much to Edinburgh, whose mail-bag was
very scanty.&nbsp; One day in 1745, we are told, the mail brought
only one letter, for the British Linen Company; and on another
day in the same year only one was despatched to London, for Sir
William Pulteney, the banker.</p>
<p>In 1750 things were no better, but eight years later an
Edinburgh merchant, George Chalmers, procured an
improvement.&nbsp; Before 1758 the Great North Mail set out three
times a week and took eighty-seven hours in going north, and not
fewer than one hundred and thirty-one from Edinburgh to
London.&nbsp; This last itinerary was lengthened so greatly in
time on account of stoppages made at Berwick and at Newcastle,
ranging from three hours at one to twenty-four at the
other.&nbsp; These delays Chalmers, in corresponding with the
officials, proved to be quite needless.&nbsp; He also induced
them to avoid the old and longer route through Thorne and York
and to take the alternative road by Boroughbridge, <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>thus
shortening the journey by twelve miles.&nbsp; The times were then
fixed at eighty-two hours for the northward-bound mail, and
eighty-five for the south.&nbsp; For his services the Government
made Chalmers a grant of &pound;600.&nbsp; Some years afterwards
he induced the Post Office to run the mails six days a week.</p>
<p>But a greater than Chalmers was at hand in Palmer, the
organiser of the mail-coach service.&nbsp; Palmer accomplished,
according to De Quincey, &ldquo;two things very hard to do on our
little planet, the earth, however cheap they may be held by
eccentric people in comets: he had invented mail-coaches, and he
had married the daughter of a duke.&nbsp; He was therefore just
twice as great a man as Galileo, who did certainly invent (or,
which is the same thing, discover) the satellites of Jupiter,
those very next things extant to mail-coaches in the two capital
pretensions of speed and keeping time; but, on the other hand,
who did not marry the daughter of a duke.&rdquo;&nbsp; Palmer
married, in point of fact, Lady Madeline Gordon, daughter of the
Duke of Richmond, but De Quincey does not lay the stress he
should have done on his having fought his postal scheme to
success against the obstinacy and red-tapeism of the Post Office
officials, itself an enterprise sufficient to daunt any but the
stoutest heart.&nbsp; Government officials have a wonderful power
of passive resistance and an insensibility to argument and proof
which might be envied by a lamp-post.&nbsp; It was thought a
brilliant rejoinder when one of these Post Office dunderheads
replied to Palmer&rsquo;s scheme for supplanting the slow and
uncertain post-boys by fast coaches with the observation that
there was no reason why the post should be the swiftest
conveyance in England!&nbsp; No doubt this witty gentleman
resigned in an access of mortification when Palmer actually
succeeded in being appointed Controller-General of the Post
Office, with a salary of &pound;1,500 a year and a two and a-half
per cent. commission on a rise of the income above the
&pound;240,000 at which it stood when he was placed at the head
of affairs.&nbsp; The first mail-coach was put upon <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>the Bath Road
on the 8th of August 1784, and its success was so great and
immediate that the chief towns of the kingdom presently began to
petition for similar facilities to be accorded them.&nbsp; York
was the first successful applicant, and a mail was put on the
road between London, York, and Edinburgh in October of the same
year, taking three nights and two days to perform the
journey.&nbsp; This was not a very remarkable rate of speed, to
be sure, but the times were not so hurried then.&nbsp; A greater
speed was attained when the roads began to be reorganised by
Telford and Macadam.&nbsp; Macadam&rsquo;s method of metalling
the existing roads and Telford&rsquo;s reconstruction of steep
and winding highways produced great results.&nbsp; To Macadam was
due the greater speeds attained at last on the mail route between
London and Edinburgh; for, although Telford&rsquo;s improved road
was begun in 1824, it was never completed owing to the
introduction of railways.&nbsp; Government had, in fact, by this
time recognised the necessity of good roads, and, fresh from the
reorganisation of the mail route between London and Holyhead, had
determined on an improved communication between England and
Scotland.&nbsp; This road, already referred to, was to be
straight and as flat as engineering science could contrive it,
and a portion&mdash;that between Edinburgh and Morpeth&mdash;was
constructed about 1824, going by way of Soutra Hill, Lauderdale,
Coldstream, and Wooler.&nbsp; The route between London and
Morpeth was also surveyed and authorised, and portions between
London and York actually begun, when the opening of the Stockton
and Darlington Railway in 1825 convinced the authorities that the
days of the road were numbered.</p>
<p>But although it was long apparent that a change was impending,
coaches were not entirely run off the Great North Road for
another twenty years, and Post Office surveyors were still busy
expediting the mails over short cuts and roads of more favourable
gradients.&nbsp; Thus in 1832 we find the Scotch mail <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>going by way
of Selby.&nbsp; Here is the official time-bill for that
year:&mdash;</p>

&ldquo;up&rdquo; mail was timed considerably slower, 45 hours 39
minutes.</p>
<p>The punctuality of the mails was so great that the Glasgow and
the Edinburgh mails, which went by Shoreditch and Islington
respectively, and took different routes as far as Alconbury Hill,
where their roads met, could always be depended upon to keep the
official interval of four minutes which divided them at that
point.&nbsp; Their route was identical between Alconbury Hill and
Doncaster, where the Glasgow mail branched off to the left to
Ferrybridge and Greta Bridge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have seen with what
extraordinary speed letters were carried in the time of Charles
the First between London and Edinburgh; but how did folk
travel?&nbsp; They rode horseback, from kings, to nobles, and
down to merchants; princesses, madam, or my lady riding
pillion.&nbsp; Private carriages&mdash;&ldquo;coaches,&rdquo;
they were called&mdash;had been introduced in 1553, when Queen
Mary rode in one, as a novelty, from London to Westminster, drawn
by six horses.&nbsp; In 1556 Sir Thomas Hoby had one of these
strange machines, and just because the fact is expressly
mentioned we see how rare they were.&nbsp; In fact, they went out
of use altogether for a time, and were reintroduced by William
Boonen, Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s Dutch coachman, in 1564.&nbsp; On
this occasion they came into better favour, and their numbers
must have greatly increased, for a Bill &ldquo;to restrain their
excessive use&rdquo; was introduced to Parliament, and rejected,
in 1601.&nbsp; But both their make and the fearful condition of
the roads forbade them being used in the country.&nbsp; Moreover,
they had only shutters in place of windows, the first
&ldquo;glass coach&rdquo; being that used by the Duke of York in
1661.</p>
<p>It was in 1658 that the first stage-coach between <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>London and
Edinburgh was put on the road.&nbsp; It set out once a fortnight,
but the length of the whole journey and just what kind of vehicle
it was are unknown.&nbsp; Four days, however, and two pounds were
consumed in travelling between London and York.&nbsp; The cost of
the whole journey was four pounds.</p>
<p>In 1734 things do not seem to have been much better, John Dale
advertising in the May of that year that a coach would take the
road from Edinburgh for London &ldquo;towards the end of each
week, to be performed in nine days, or three days sooner than any
coach that travels that road.&rdquo;&nbsp; After this matters
went from bad to worse, and speed was slower twenty years later
than it had been for a long time.</p>
<p>The <i>Edinburgh Courant</i> of 1754 contained the following
advertisement:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">THE EDINBURGH STAGE

</blockquote>
<p>Even Hosea Eastgate&rsquo;s conveyance stands forth as a
miracle of swiftness and frequency when compared with the coach
of 1763, which set out once a month and took a <i>fortnight</i>,
<i>if the weather was favourable</i>!&nbsp; Probably this
degeneracy of coaches was due to the practice of travellers
clubbing together to hire a post-chaise for the journey.&nbsp;
This was a plan eminently <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>characteristic of the Scottish
mind.&nbsp; It both secured quicker travelling and saved
expense.&nbsp; The Edinburgh papers of that time often contained
advertisements inquiring for a fellow-passenger to share these
costs and charges.</p>
<p>Edinburgh, as a matter of fact, even now a far cry, was beyond
the ken of most Londoners in those times, and London was to
Edinburgh folks a place dimly heard of, and never to be visited,
save perhaps once in a lifetime.&nbsp; York, half-way, was better
known, and was well supplied with coaches.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Black
Swan&rdquo; in Coney Street, York, received and sent forth a
coach&mdash;in after years known as the &ldquo;York Old
Coach&rdquo;&mdash;so early as 1698.&nbsp; This appears to have
always laid up for the winter and come out again in April, like
the cuckoo, as a harbinger of spring.&nbsp; One of these spring
announcements was discovered, some years since, in an old drawer
at the &ldquo;Black Swan.&rdquo;&nbsp; It runs:&mdash;</p>

</blockquote>
<p><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>It is
singular that this coach should have had a &ldquo;Black
Swan&rdquo; at either end of its journey.&nbsp; The London house
was in later years the well-known &ldquo;Black Swan
Distillery&rdquo; in Holborn.</p>
<p>To display the many coaches, their names and times of arrival
and departure in these pages would afford but dull reading.&nbsp;
Besides, Paterson and Cary, those encyclop&aelig;dic old
road-books, contain lists of them in interminable array: the
&ldquo;Highflyers,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rockinghams,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Unions,&rdquo; &ldquo;Amitys,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Defiances,&rdquo; &ldquo;Wellingtons,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Bluchers,&rdquo; &ldquo;Nelsons,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Rodneys,&rdquo; and what not.&nbsp; There was so
extraordinary a run upon these popular names that they are often
triplicated&mdash;and sometimes occur six times&mdash;on the
local and byroad coaches; with the result that if the traveller
desired to travel by the &ldquo;Highflyer,&rdquo; let us say, to
Edinburgh, he had to carefully sort it out from other
&ldquo;Highflyers&rdquo; which flew not only to Leeds but to all
kinds of obscure places.</p>
<p>The early stage-coaches must have been terribly trying.&nbsp;
They were, as Byron says of the &ldquo;kibitka,&rdquo; &ldquo;a
cursed kind of carriage without springs.&rdquo;&nbsp; As time
went on they were not only provided with glass windows,
but&mdash;as duly set forth in the advertisements&mdash;were
furnished with springs and cushions.&nbsp; The resources of
civilisation were not exhausted at this point, for it was gravely
announced that the guards were armed, and the coaches were
bullet-proof!</p>
<p>The life of a coach-proprietor was all hard work, with no
little anxiety attached.&nbsp; Up early and to bed late&mdash;for
on however large a scale his business might be, it was one
peculiarly dependent upon the master&rsquo;s eye&mdash;he knew
the inner meaning of the primeval curse, and earned his living by
the sweat of his brow.&nbsp; And, lest that was not sufficient,
the Government sweated him in a financial sense.&nbsp; The
coaching business was the especial prey of Chancellors of the
Exchequer, and yielded huge returns.&nbsp; If it be argued that
coach-proprietors, unlike railway companies, had no parliamentary
powers to obtain, <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>and no enormous expenses for purchase of land and
construction of lines, this can be met by setting forth the heavy
duties and taxes, the great outlay on turnpike tolls, and the
relatively high cost of haulage by horses.&nbsp; The initial
expenses of a railway are immense, the upkeep of lines and
buildings large; but the actual cost of steam-power as against
horse-traction is absurdly little.&nbsp; Railways, of course, pay
passenger duty, and immense sums in the aggregate for rates and
taxes; but they are not burdened as the coaches were.&nbsp; If it
cost from &pound;3 10s. to &pound;6 15s. to travel
&ldquo;outside&rdquo; or &ldquo;inside&rdquo; by ordinary
stage-coach between London and Edinburgh, those high figures were
the necessary results of Government exactions and turnpike
imposts.&nbsp; Duties and taxes varied from time to time, but a
stage-coach licensed, about 1830, to carry fifteen passengers
paid a duty of threepence a mile, whether the coach carried a
full load or not.&nbsp; Thus, for every single journey, a coach
licensed to that extent paid &pound;4 19s. 3d.&nbsp; A coach
could be licensed to carry a smaller number, when the duties
would be proportionately lighter, and coaches licensed for
fifteen or so during the summer would take out a licence for
perhaps six or eight in winter, when travellers were few and far
between.</p>
<p>Suppose, now, that we roughly add up the working expenses of a
stage-coach to Edinburgh.&nbsp; We start with the passenger-duty
of &pound;4 19s. 3d.&nbsp; To this we add, say, &pound;4 for hire
of coach at the rate of 2&frac12;d. a mile; &pound;4 19s. 3d. for
horsing, at 3d. a mile; and &pound;6 12s., turnpikes, at
4d.&nbsp; This gives a total of &pound;20 10s. 6d.&nbsp; But we
have not yet done with expenses, including wages for coachmen,
guards, ostlers, and helpers; advertising, rent, oil for lamps,
greasing, washing, etc.</p>
<p>There would be six, or perhaps seven, coachmen, one driving
about sixty miles, when he would be relieved by another; and
perhaps four guards, because guards, not having the physical
exertion of driving, could go longer journeys.&nbsp; The
proportion of their <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>week&rsquo;s wages must be added to the debit account
for the one journey, together with the proportion of the &pound;5
yearly tax payable for every coachman and guard employed, and a
similar annual sum for the coach itself.&nbsp; Any more
items?&nbsp; Oh yes!&nbsp; Office expenses, clerks, etc., and
incidentals.&nbsp; If we lump all these items together, they will
mean an additional &pound;12 cost on every journey to or from
Edinburgh, bringing the cost to the proprietors to over
&pound;32.</p>
<p>Now for the other side of the account.&nbsp; Our coach is
licensed for fifteen, and if we carry our four insides and eleven
outsides all the way, it holds &pound;65 10s. at the fares named
above&mdash;about 4d. and 2d. a mile respectively.&nbsp; But how
often were those fifteen &ldquo;through&rdquo; passengers?&nbsp;
Not more, perhaps, than half would be bound for Edinburgh.&nbsp;
Others might alight at York, or even at Grantham or
Stamford.&nbsp; Others, again, might go to Newcastle.&nbsp; For
fares thus lost, the proprietors looked to chance passengers; but
the shillings and perhaps the two shillings taken on the way for
short distances went, by common consent, into the
coachmen&rsquo;s and guards&rsquo; pockets, and were never
entered on the way-bill.&nbsp; In this manner, and by their
&ldquo;tips,&rdquo; the men added to their somewhat meagre wages,
which, rightly considered, were retaining-fees rather than full
payment.&nbsp; This practice was generally known as
&ldquo;shouldering.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some proprietors, however, were
stricter than others, and did not allow it.&nbsp; Of course it
went on all the same, and the standing toast which they were
compelled to give at annual coaching dinners, &ldquo;Success to
shouldering,&rdquo; with the proviso, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t let
me find you at it,&rdquo; was a tacit acknowledgment of the
custom.&nbsp; In later days, when proprietors paid slightly
higher wages and tried to forbid tips, the coachmen were loth to
give up these odd sums, for the diminution of tips was greater
than the increase of wages.&nbsp; They then pocketed larger
fares, and called the practice &ldquo;swallowing.&rdquo;&nbsp; A
tale is told of a coach approaching town, and the coachman asking
his box-seat passenger <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>if he had any luggage.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the passenger.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo;
rejoined the coachman, &ldquo;do you mind getting down here, sir,
because I mean to swallow you.&rdquo;&nbsp; The passenger got
down, and was &ldquo;swallowed&rdquo; accordingly.</p>
<p>The average takings of the coach would certainly never, at the
best of it, come to more than &pound;50 a journey, leaving a
balance of &pound;15 10s. profit.&nbsp; Now, taking a year of
three hundred and thirteen days, and coaches &ldquo;up&rdquo; and
&ldquo;down,&rdquo; this gives a profit of
&pound;9,702&mdash;not, be it borne in mind, going to one
man.&nbsp; The &ldquo;end men&rdquo; had the greatest share, as
they had also the heaviest expenses, and the &ldquo;middle-ground
men&rdquo; got little beyond the mileage on which they horsed the
coaches; but with twenty-five stages or so, and twenty-five
participants in the profits, it will be seen that the individual
earnings on one coach could not be classed very high.</p>
<h2>VI</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a costly as well as a
lengthy business to travel from London to Edinburgh.&nbsp; Not so
lengthy, of course, by mail as by stage-coach, but much more
expensive.&nbsp; If you wished to take it comfortably during the
forty-two hours and a-half or so of travelling, you went inside,
especially if it happened to be in winter; but an inside place
cost eleven guineas and a-half, which was thought a much larger
sum in 1830 than it would be nowadays.&nbsp; Accordingly, the
stalwart and the not particularly well-to-do, who at the same
time wanted to travel quickly, went outside, whereby they saved
no less than four guineas.</p>
<p>But let not the reader think that these respective sums of
eleven and a-half and seven and a-half guineas comprised the
whole of the traveller&rsquo;s expenses in the old days.&nbsp;
There were numerous people to tip, such as porters, waiters, and
last, but certainly not the least of them, the coachmen and
guards, who at the <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>end of their respective journeys, when they left their
seats to a new guard or a new Jehu, &ldquo;kicked&rdquo; the
passengers, as the expressive phrase went, for their respective
two shillings or so.&nbsp; To be kicked at intervals in this
figurative manner, all the way between London and Edinburgh, was
not physically painful, but it came expensive; and what with the
necessary meals and refreshments during those forty-two hours or
so, it could scarce have cost an &ldquo;inside&rdquo; less than
fifteen guineas, or an &ldquo;outside&rdquo; less than
eleven.</p>
<p>Now let us take the mazy &ldquo;Bradshaw&rdquo; or the simpler
&ldquo;A B C&rdquo; railway guides, and see what it will cost us
in time and pocket to reach the capital of Scotland.&nbsp; A vast
difference, you may be sure.&nbsp; It is possible to go by three
different routes, but the distance is much the same, and the
times vary little, whether you go by Midland, London and
North-Western, or by the Great Northern Railway.&nbsp; The
last-named has, on the whole, the best of it, with a mileage of
395 miles, and a fast train performing the journey in seven hours
and twenty-five minutes.&nbsp; It costs by any of these routes
for first-class travelling, which answers to the
&ldquo;inside&rdquo; of old times, fifty-seven shillings and
sixpence, and thirty-two shillings and eightpence by third-class,
equivalent to the &ldquo;outside.&rdquo; <a
name="citation40"></a><a href="#footnote40"
class="citation">[40]</a>&nbsp; You need not tip unless you like,
and even then but once or twice, and assuredly no one will ask
you for one.&nbsp; Whether you travel &ldquo;first&rdquo; or
&ldquo;third,&rdquo; a dining-saloon and an excellent dinner are
at your service for a moderate sum, and the sun scarce rises or
sets with greater certainty than that the Scotch express or its
London equivalent will set out or reach its destination at its
appointed minute.</p>
<p>Accidents&mdash;when they happen&mdash;are beyond comparison
more fearful on the railway than ever they were on the coaches;
but they are rare indeed when it is considered how many trains
are run.&nbsp; Coaching accidents were frequent, but just because
they seldom ended fatally they do not figure so largely in
coaching <a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>annals as might be expected.&nbsp; A dreadful accident,
however, happened in 1805 to the Leeds &ldquo;Union&rdquo; coach,
owing to the reins breaking and the horses dashing the vehicle
against a tree.&nbsp; This occurred at a point about half a mile
from Ferrybridge.&nbsp; William Hope, the coachman, and an
outside passenger were killed, and many others seriously
injured.&nbsp; The jury imposed a deodand of &pound;5 on the
coach and &pound;10 on the horses.</p>
<p>In later years, an almost equally serious disaster happened to
another Leeds coach, the &ldquo;Express.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was
racing with the opposition &ldquo;Courier,&rdquo; which had been
stopped at the bottom of the hill for the purpose of taking off
the drag, and in the effort to pass was upset, with the result
that a woman was killed on the spot, another was laid up for a
year with a broken leg, and other passengers were more or less
injured.&nbsp; Probably because of the evident recklessness
displayed by the coachman, a deodand of &pound;1,400 was laid on
the coach.&nbsp; The mail-coaches were not so often involved in
disasters as the stages.&nbsp; They had not the incentive to
race, and smashes arising from this form of competition were
infrequent.&nbsp; But other forms of accident threatened them and
the stage-coaches alike.&nbsp; There were, for instance, fogs,
and they were exceedingly dangerous.&nbsp; Penny, an old driver
of the Edinburgh mail, was killed from this cause.&nbsp; Starting
one foggy night, he grew nervous, and asked the guard, a younger
and stronger man, to take the reins.&nbsp; He did so, and drove
up a bank.&nbsp; The mail was upset, and Penny was killed.</p>
<p>Snow and frost were the especial foes of the mails on the
northern stretches of the Great North Road, just as widespread
floods were in the Huntingdonshire and Nottinghamshire levels, by
Ouse and Trent; so that no mail-coach was completely equipped
which did not in the winter months carry a snow-shovel.</p>
<p>But it was not always the north-country coaches that felt the
fury of the snowstorms.&nbsp; The famous storm of December 1836
blocked all roads impartially.&nbsp; <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>The Louth mail, which left the Great
North Road at Norman Cross, had to be abandoned and the mails
transferred to the lighter agency of a post-chaise, while
numerous others were buried in the snow as far south as St.
Albans.</p>
<p>The earlier and later periods of coaching were productive of
accidents in equal degrees.&nbsp; Stage-coaches may be said to
date, roughly, from 1698, and continued as lumbering,
uncomfortable conveyances until competition with the mails began
to smarten them up, soon after 1784, when their second period
dawned.&nbsp; Stage-coachmen of the first period were well
matched with their machines, and not often fit to be trusted with
any other cattle than a team of tired plough-horses.&nbsp; Their
want of skill generally caused the accidents in those days, and
the efficiency of others was affected by the conditions of their
employment.&nbsp; The &ldquo;classic&rdquo; age had not arrived,
and bad roads, ill-made coaches, and poor horses, combined with
long hours of driving to render travelling quite dangerous
enough, without the highwaymen&rsquo;s aid.&nbsp; Coachmen drove
long distances in those days, and sometimes fell asleep from
sheer weariness&mdash;a failing which did not conduce to the
safety of the passengers.&nbsp; But the old coach-proprietors did
not do the obvious thing&mdash;make the stages shorter and change
the coachman more frequently.&nbsp; No; they contrived a hard,
uncomfortable seat for him which rested on the bed of the
axletree in such a manner as to shake every bone in his body, and
to render repose quite out of the question.</p>

<p>To these clumsy or worn-out fellows succeeded the dashing
charioteers of the palmy age of coaching, which we may say came
into full being with the year 1800, and lasted for full thirty
years.&nbsp; Many broken heads and limbs, and bruises and
contusions innumerable, can be laid to the account of these gay
sportsmen.&nbsp; Washington Irving has left us a portrait of the
typical stage-coachman of this time, in this delightful literary
jewel:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He cannot be mistaken for one of any other
craft.&nbsp; <a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>He has commonly a broad full face, curiously mottled
with red, as if the blood had been forced by hard feeding into
every vessel of the skin; he is swelled into jolly dimensions by
frequent potations of malt liquors, and his bulk is still further
increased by a multiplicity of coats in which he is buried like a
cauliflower, the upper one reaching to his heels.&nbsp; He wears
a broad-brimmed, low-crowned hat, a huge roll of coloured
handkerchief about his neck, knowingly knotted and tucked in at
the bosom, and has in summer-time a large bouquet of flowers in
his buttonhole&mdash;the present, most probably, of some
enamoured country lass.&nbsp; His waistcoat is commonly of some
bright colour, striped; and his small-clothes extend far below
the knees, to meet a pair of jockey-boots which reach about
half-way up his legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this costume is maintained with much precision; he
has a pride in having his clothes of excellent materials, and,
notwithstanding the seeming grossness of his appearance, there is
still discernible that neatness and propriety of person which is
almost inherent in an Englishman.&nbsp; He enjoys great
confidence and consideration along the road; has frequent
conferences with the village housewives, who look upon him as a
man of great trust and dependence, and he seems to have a good
understanding with every bright-eyed country lass.&nbsp; The
moment he arrives where the horses are to be changed, he throws
down the reins with something of an air, and abandons the cattle
to the care of the ostler; his duty being merely to drive from
one stage to another.&nbsp; When off the box, his hands are
thrust into the pockets of his great-coat, and he rolls about the
inn-yard with an air of the most absolute lordliness.&nbsp; Here
he is generally surrounded by an admiring throng of ostlers,
stable-boys, shoe-blacks, and those nameless hangers-on that
infest inns and taverns, and run errands, and do all kinds of odd
jobs for the privilege of battening on the drippings of the
kitchen and the leakings of the tap-room.&nbsp; These all look up
to him as an oracle, treasure up his cant <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>phrases, echo
his opinions about horses and other topics of jockey-lore, and,
above all, endeavour to imitate his air and carriage.&nbsp; Every
ragamuffin that has a coat to his back thrusts his hands in the
pockets, rolls in his gait, talks slang, and is an embryo
coachey.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But how different the last years of this gorgeous
figure!&nbsp; When railways were projected, the coachman laughed
at the idea.&nbsp; He thought himself secure on his box-seat, and
witnessed the preparations for laying the iron rails with an
amused confidence that his horses could run the
&ldquo;tin-kettles&rdquo; off the road with little trouble.&nbsp;
He kept this frame of mind even until the opening of the line
that competed with him; and even when it was proved to
demonstration that railways could convey passengers at least
three times as swiftly as coaches, and at about a quarter of the
cost, he generally professed to believe that &ldquo;it
couldn&rsquo;t last long.&rdquo;&nbsp; His was the faith that
should have moved mountains&mdash;to say nothing of blighting
locomotives; but it was no use.&nbsp; His old passengers deserted
him.&nbsp; They were not proof against the opportunities of
saving time and money.&nbsp; Who is?&nbsp; Nor did they come back
to him, as he fondly thought they would, half-choked with cinders
and smoke.&nbsp; He was speedily run off the road.&nbsp; There
were those who liked him well, and, unwilling to see him brought
low, made interest with railway companies to secure him a post;
but he indignantly refused it when obtained; and, finding a
cross-country route to which the railway had not yet penetrated,
drove the coachman&rsquo;s horror&mdash;a pair-horse
coach&mdash;along the by-ways.&nbsp; Gone by now was his lordly
importance.&nbsp; He had not even a guard, and frequently was
reduced to putting in the horses himself.&nbsp; He grew slovenly,
and was maudlin in his drink.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tips&rdquo; were
seldom bestowed upon him, and when he received an infrequent
sixpenny-piece, he was known to burst into tears.&nbsp; The
familiar figure of Belisarius begging an obolus is scarce more
painful.&nbsp; The last of him was generally in the driving of
the omnibus between the railway station and the hotel; a <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>misanthropic
figure, consistently disregarded by his passengers, lingering,
resolutely old-fashioned in dress, and none too civil,
superfluous on the stage.</p>

<h2>VII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">These</span> long preliminaries over, we
may duly start for the North from the General Post Office, coming
to Islington by way of Goswell Road.&nbsp; Here, at the
&ldquo;Peacock&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Angel,&rdquo; travellers of a
century and a-half ago were one mile from London, or from
Hicks&rsquo;s Hall, which was the same thing.&nbsp; A milestone
proclaimed the fact, and its successor, with a different legend,
stood until quite recently opposite the Grand Theatre, on
Islington Green.&nbsp; Here stood the first toll-gate as you went
out of London.&nbsp; Here also was the village pound for strayed
horses and cattle.&nbsp; Here again, according to those who do
not know anything at all about it, the bailiff&rsquo;s daughter
of Islington might have met her lover; only, unhappily for this
Islington, the old ballad refers to quite another Islington, away
in Norfolk.</p>
<p>The usual suburban perils awaited wayfarers to Islington at
any time during the eighteenth century, and those bound for it
from the city were accustomed to wait at the Smithfield end of
St. John Street until a number had collected, when they were
convoyed outwards by the armed patrol stationed there for that
purpose.&nbsp; But the footpads were quite equal to the occasion,
and simply waited until those parties dispersed for their several
homes, and then, like skilful generals, attacked them in
detail.&nbsp; The Islington Vestry were obliged to make a
standing offer of &pound;10 to any one who should arrest a
robber; but that this failed seems certain, for at a later period
we find the inhabitants subscribing a fund for rewards to those
who arrested evildoers.</p>
<p><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>Time
has wrought sad havoc with Islington&rsquo;s once rural aspect,
and with its old coaching inns.&nbsp; That grand coaching centre,
the &ldquo;Peacock,&rdquo; has utterly vanished, and so has the
picturesque &ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s Head,&rdquo;&mdash;gabled,
Elizabethan&mdash;wantonly destroyed in 1829; while the
&ldquo;Angel,&rdquo; pulled down in 1819 and rebuilt, and again
rebuilt in 1900, has since retired from business as a
public-house, and is now a tea and lunch place, in the hands of a
popular firm of caterers.&nbsp; In early days, and well on into
the nineteenth century, the Green was really a pleasant spot,
with tall elms shading the footpaths, and a very rustic-looking
pound for strayed cattle.&nbsp; Near by stood for many years a
little hatter&rsquo;s shop, bearing the legend in large
characters, &ldquo;Old Hats Beavered,&rdquo; and it is curious to
note how, in a long succession of old prints, this shop and its
now curiously sounding notice kept their place while all else was
changing.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Islington was once a Cockney paradise, and to it <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>retired, as
into the country, the good citizens and shopkeepers of London,
setting up miniature parks and pleasances of their own.&nbsp; So
favourite a practice was this that the witlings of that period, a
hundred and fifty years ago, used to publish absurd notices
supposed to have been found displayed at the entrances of these
haunts.&nbsp; &ldquo;The New Paradise,&rdquo; ran one of them,
&ldquo;Gentlemen with Nails in their Boots not
Admitted.&rdquo;&nbsp; Perhaps also &ldquo;Serpents Warned
Off.&rdquo;&nbsp; At that time, and long before, Islington was
resorted to on account of some alleged mineral waters existing
here.&nbsp; &ldquo;Islington,&rdquo; according to M. Henri
Misson, who travelled in England, and wrote a book about us and
our country in 1718, &ldquo;is a large village, half a league
from London, where you drink waters that do you neither good nor
harm, provided you don&rsquo;t take too much of
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is decidedly a &ldquo;palpable
hit,&rdquo; and may be commended to those who take medicinal
waters in our own time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not much flock&rsquo;d to by People of
Quality,&rdquo; he goes on to observe.&nbsp; Here, at least, he
is not out of date.&nbsp; People of Quality do not flock to
Islington.&nbsp; The medicinal waters are all gone; and that
Islington is, even now, not in any great degree a resort of
fashion is an incontrovertible fact.</p>
<p>Between this and Highgate, the road leading to what the poets
call the &ldquo;true and tender North&rdquo; is by no means
happy.&nbsp; Any other of the classic highways of England begins
better, and however delightful the Holloway Road may have been in
the coaching age, it is in these crowded days a very commonplace
thoroughfare indeed.&nbsp; The long reaches of mean streets and
sordid bye-roads combine with the unutterably bad road surface to
render the exit from London anything but pleasurable.</p>
<p>Sir Walter Scott, on his way down to Abbotsford in 1826, calls
the Great North Road &ldquo;the dullest road in the world, though
the most convenient,&rdquo; and the description, minus the
convenience, might well stand for its suburban portion
to-day.&nbsp; In Sir Walter&rsquo;s time, <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>however,
these first few miles were only just emerging from a condition in
which dulness could have had no part.&nbsp; In fact, it may well
be supposed that the travellers, who up to that time went by
coach to York, well armed, found the journey a thought too
lively.&nbsp; Indeed, the Holloway Road, into which they came,
from the last outposts of civilisation, was, as it were the
ante-chamber into that direful territory of highwaymen and
footpads, the veritable Alsatias of Finchley Common and
Whetstone.&nbsp; In fact, a few years earlier still, when there
were no houses at Holloway at all, and no district known by that
name, what is now called the Holloway Road was a lonely track,
full of mud and water, through which the coach route ran,
infested all the while by the most villainous characters,
compared with whom the gay highwayman in ruffles and lace, and
mounted on a mettlesome horse, was a knight indeed&mdash;a
chevalier without fear or reproach.&nbsp; This stretch of road
lay then between high banks, and considerably below the level of
the surrounding fields.&nbsp; It was a &ldquo;hollow&rdquo; road,
as such roads are called wherever they exist in the
country&mdash;the actual, original Hollow Way from which, in the
course of time, a whole residential district has obtained its
name.&nbsp; Such roads, worn down through the earth by constant
traffic, are always very ancient, and though the story of the
Holloway Road at a period from a hundred and fifty to eighty
years ago was a disgraceful one, the inhabitants of that part can
console themselves by the soothing thought that, although it
cannot claim the Roman ancestry of the route by Shoreditch,
Waltham Cross and Cheshunt, which was the Ermine Way, the road in
question probably dates back to the respectable antiquity of
medi&aelig;val times.</p>
<h2><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>VIII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> road has been ascending ever
since the General Post Office was left behind, and now we come to
the beginning of Highgate Hill, where the old way over the
hill-top, and the more recent one, dating from 1813, divide left
and right.&nbsp; Here, at the junction of Salisbury Road with
Highgate Hill, stands the Whittington Stone, marking the
traditional spot where Dick rested on his flight, and heard the
bells inviting him to</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Turn again, Whittington,<br />
Thrice Lord Mayor of London.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a pretty story, and one which, let us hope, will never
be forgotten or popularly discredited; how the boy, running away
from ill-treatment at his master&rsquo;s house in the city,
halted here in his four-miles&rsquo; flight, and resting on the
slope of Highgate Hill, saw the clustered spires of London and
the silvery Thames&mdash;it <i>was</i> silvery then&mdash;down
below, and heard the prophetic message of Bow Bells inviting him
to return.&nbsp; If we can believe that he had his favourite cat
with him, let us believe with joy, because it goes far to
complete the tender story which has always held captive the
hearts of the children; and God forbid we should grow the less
tender towards the beautiful legends of our forbears as we grow
older.</p>
<p>Bow Bells fulfilled their prophecy in full measure and running
over, for Dick Whittington was chosen to complete the year of
Mayor&mdash;Adam Bamme&mdash;who died in 1397, and was Mayor on
three separate occasions as well; in 1397, 1406, and 1420.&nbsp;
He was knighted, of course, and, moreover, he became one of the
richest men of his time.&nbsp; Perhaps the most dramatic thing
recorded of his prosperous career as Mayor and a member of the
Mercers&rsquo; Company, is that splendid entertainment which he
gave to Henry the Fifth and <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>his Queen at Guildhall in his last
year of office, when he threw into the fire bonds equal to
&pound;60,000 of our money, due to him from the king&mdash;a
generous, nay, a princely gift.</p>
<p>But he was not &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; Mayor.&nbsp; The tradition
is wrong in that respect.&nbsp; There were &ldquo;Mayors,&rdquo;
but no &ldquo;Lord Mayor&rdquo; until 1486.</p>
<p>Who was Richard Whittington?&nbsp; We know him well in his
later career as a Mercer, and as a pious and patriotic citizen;
but whence came he?&nbsp; Was he the poor and friendless lad of
legend?&nbsp; Well, not quite that.&nbsp; Poor, perhaps, because
he was the youngest of three brothers; but not friendless, for
his family was of no mean descent.&nbsp; His father, Sir William
Whittington, had an estate on which he lived, at Pauntley, in
Gloucestershire, and other possessions of the family were at
Sollers Hope, Herefordshire.&nbsp; Misfortunes fell upon Sir
William, who seems to have died not long after Dick was born; but
the family had friends in the FitzWarrens, of whom one, Sir John,
was a prominent Mercer in London.&nbsp; Dick&rsquo;s brothers
had, as elder brothers have nowadays, the best chances, as it
seemed, and remained in the country, enjoying the family
property, or following rural employments.&nbsp; Dick we may
readily picture as being sent to FitzWarren, to learn a
trade.&nbsp; The great man probably took him for old
acquaintance&rsquo; sake, and, having received the lad of
thirteen, and turned him over to one of his many underlings,
promptly forgot him.&nbsp; It is a way with the great, not yet
obsolete.&nbsp; We may with a good conscience reject that part of
the legend which tells how Dick was found, an obscure waif and
stray, on FitzWarren&rsquo;s doorstep, and taken, in compassion,
to serve as a scullion.&nbsp; The pantomimes always insist on
this, and on the ferocious cook&rsquo;s ill-treatment of him; but
pantomime librettists have many sins to answer for.</p>
<p>No; Dick was an apprentice, a poor one, and doubtless taken
without a premium; but not scullion.&nbsp; There can be little
doubt that the country <a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>lad, thus thrown into the midst of
many other apprentices in FitzWarren&rsquo;s house, must have
been an object of sport.&nbsp; They would taunt him with his
country ways, and, superior in their clothes of London cut,
ridicule, with the cruel satire of boys, his homely duds.&nbsp;
Possibly his flight had some such origin as this.</p>
<p>But it is chiefly on the legend of the cat that more or less
learned antiquaries have so savagely fallen, with intent to
explain it away.&nbsp; The cat, they assure us, was a fable, and
they go on to say that it was from coal vessels called
&ldquo;cats,&rdquo; in which Whittington embarked his money, that
the story grew.&nbsp; Another school of commentators, eager to
reduce the pretty tale to commonplace, tell us that it originated
in the old French word for a purchase, <i>achat</i>.&nbsp; To
what shifts will they not proceed in this hunt for an ignoble
realism!&nbsp; Whittington is not known to have engaged in the
ownership of colliers, or in the carrying of coal.&nbsp; A Mercer
has no commerce with such things.&nbsp; Then, that derivation
from the French <i>does</i> smell of the lamp, does it not?</p>
<p>Now for the truth of his embarking his favourite cat as a
venture, to be sold at a profit in some foreign port.&nbsp; The
story, regarded with a knowledge of those times, is by no means
an improbable one.&nbsp; Indeed, to go further, it is quite
likely.&nbsp; Cats were in that era comparatively rare.&nbsp;
They had a high value at home; were even more valuable in Europe,
and in the darkly-known countries on the confines of the known
world&mdash;a small world, too, before the discovery of
America&mdash;they were almost priceless.</p>
<p>Many childish searchings of heart have arisen over
Dick&rsquo;s parting with his cat for love of gain.&nbsp; Did
Dick, like the Arab who sold his steed, repent with tears?&nbsp;
Perhaps Dick was the happy possessor of two cats, and his
favourite was a &ldquo;tom.&rdquo;&nbsp; If the other was a
she-cat, and as prolific as are our own, no doubt Dick would have
been glad to have got rid of her; except that the progeny
themselves were marketable.&nbsp; To <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>this, then, we are reduced: that Dick
Whittington as a boy bred cats for exportation, and that his
black-and-white Tom, as the progenitor of them all, was the
founder of his fortunes.&nbsp; The legend tells us of only one
cat, which, when the vessel was driven out of her course to the
coast of Barbary, was sold for immense riches of gold and
precious stones to the Sultan, whose palace was infested with
mice.&nbsp; That may do for the pantomimes; but, unhappily, the
ships that were so unfortunate in those times as to be driven on
those shores were plundered and their crews slain.&nbsp; It was
cheaper than buying.</p>
<p>But whatever the details, it is certain that Whittington owed
his first successes to his cat.&nbsp; Several things, despite all
destructive criticism, point to the essential truth of the
popular story.&nbsp; Firstly, original portraits, painted from
the life, testify to it by showing Whittington&rsquo;s hand laid
caressingly on a black and white cat.&nbsp; Then, Whittington was
the rebuilder of the old New Gate, and his effigy, with a cat at
his feet, stood in one of its niches until the building was
pulled down hundreds of years afterwards.&nbsp; Finally, a very
remarkable confirmation of the story came from Gloucester in
1862, when, on a house occupied by the Whittington family until
1460 being repaired, the fragment of a carved chimney-piece of
that century was discovered, bearing the sculpture of a boy
carrying a cat in his arms.&nbsp; It may reasonably be claimed
that these evidences, together with the popular belief in the
story, which can be traced back almost to Whittington&rsquo;s own
day, confound unbelievers.</p>
<p>The present Whittington Stone is the degenerate and highly
unornamental descendant of quite a number of vanished memorials
to the great Lord Mayor which have occupied this spot since his
day.&nbsp; It is not by any means a romantic spot to the sight
nowadays, but for those who can bring romance with them in their
own minds, it matters little that the heights just here are
crowned with suburban villa roads, that a public-house&mdash;the
&ldquo;Whittington Stone <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>Tavern&rdquo;&mdash;stands by, or
that the whole neighbourhood reeks vulgarity.&nbsp; The present
stone is dated 1821, and succeeded one which had disappeared
shortly before, itself the successor in 1795 of a cross.&nbsp;
The existing inscription was recut, and railings enclosing the
stone put up in 1869; a public-house gas-lamp now crowning and
desecrating the whole.</p>
<h2>IX</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a far cry from the London
County Council, the present highway authority at Highgate, to the
first roadmaker here, in 1364.&nbsp; A hermit, William Phelippe
by name, at that time lived in a little cell on the lower slope
of Highgate Hill, looking down upon London.&nbsp; From that
remote eyrie, had he been a man of imagination, he might have
beheld prophetic visions of London&rsquo;s future sprawling
greatness, when the tide of life should rise to the crest of his
hill and bring with it bricks and mortar, wood-pavements,
cable-tramways, and other things of equal use and beauty.&nbsp;
He foresaw none of these things, possibly because he did not
sufficiently mortify the flesh.&nbsp; Certainly he was a hermit
not without wealth, and perhaps therefore not one of your
sad-eyed ascetics.&nbsp; He had a goodly balance in some old
earthenware crock under the floor, or at the bank&mdash;the road
bank of the Hollow Way, very old-established&mdash;and he had
ample leisure, unencroached upon by toilette requirements, for
which hermits had no use.&nbsp; Lazing in his cell commanding the
road&mdash;it stood near where the Whittington Stone stands
now&mdash;he had often noticed how wet, miry, and full of sloughs
was the Hollow Way, and with what difficulty travellers ascended
by it.&nbsp; Accordingly he devised a scheme by which he
conferred benefits alike upon the travellers along the road and
the farmers of Highgate.&nbsp; He directed and paid for the
digging of gravel and the laying of it along the road, and in <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>the work
presently expended all his money.&nbsp; But in so doing he had
made an excellent investment; much better than leaving it on
deposit at the bank mentioned above, where, in the nature of
things, it accrued no interest; for he procured a decree from
Edward the Third, authorising &ldquo;our well-beloved William
Phelippe, the hermit,&rdquo; to set up a toll-bar, and licensing
him to levy tolls and keep the road in repair for &ldquo;our
people passing between Heghgate and Smethfelde.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus
were the first toll-bar and the first turnpike-keeper
established, and we may judge that the undertaking was profitable
from the records that show how very largely the roadside hermits
throughout the country went into the business of road and bridge
making or mending shortly afterwards.&nbsp; There were hermits of
sorts: some authorised, and some not; some who did good work in
this wise and some who did nothing at all, and yet continued to
live substantially on the mistaken gifts of wayfarers.&nbsp; The
profession of the eremite was not without its jealousies.&nbsp;
An industrious road-maker might have a cell placed in a position
outside a town favourable for the collection of dues, when
another would set up business, say a quarter of a mile further
out, and so intercept the money; so that travellers having paid
once, had nothing for the real Simon Pure.&nbsp; Having satisfied
Codlin, they disregarded Short; whereupon it not infrequently
happened that if Short were the more muscular of the two he would
go and have it out with his rival, while the world went by,
scandalised at the apostolic blows and knocks these holy men were
dealing one another.</p>
<p>William Phelippe&rsquo;s licence was renewed every year.&nbsp;
His tariff of tolls is still extant, and we read that for every
cart carrying merchandise, its wheels shod with iron, twopence
per week was paid; if not shod with iron, one penny.&nbsp; Every
horse carrying merchandise was charged one farthing per
week.&nbsp; Pedestrians and horsemen without goods went
free.&nbsp; These charges seem absurdly small until we multiply
them by twenty, which gives results representing the present
value of <a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>money, and then it will be found that those ancient
tolls were on much the same scale as those which existed until
July 1st, 1864, when all turnpikes on public highways within
fifty miles of London were abolished by Act of Parliament.</p>
<p>A great gap stretches between the time of our road-making
hermit and that of Telford&mdash;a gap of four hundred and fifty
years.&nbsp; Yet, although Highway Acts were from time to time
devised for the betterment of the roads, their condition remained
bad, and there was always, since 1386, the crest of Highgate Hill
to surmount.</p>
<p>Unless we take this hill-top route to the left we shall not
have seen Highgate; nor, in truth, is there much to see, now that
the old Gatehouse Tavern is gone, and with it the last outward
and visible connection with the days of yore.&nbsp; The tavern
marked the site of the old turnpike-gate that stood here, the
lineal successor of the hermit&rsquo;s original pitch lower down,
when the old route to Barnet by Tallingdon Lane, Crouch End,
Hornsey Great Park, Muswell Hill, Friern Barnet, and Whetstone
was superseded by the new one through the Bishop of
London&rsquo;s estate, by Finchley and Whetstone, in 1386.&nbsp;
It is in the existence at that time of the Bishop&rsquo;s park
that we may perhaps seek with success the origin of the name of
&ldquo;Highgate,&rdquo; which does not necessarily allude to the
very obviously &ldquo;high&rdquo; gate situated here&mdash;more
than 350 feet above sea-level.&nbsp; No; it was the
&ldquo;haigh&rdquo; gate, the portal which gave access through
the enclosure (<i>haia</i>) with which my Lord Bishop&rsquo;s
domain was presumably surrounded.&nbsp; Through his land all
traffic passed until it emerged on the other side of Whetstone,
where, commanding the entrance to Barnet, stood another gate in
receipt of tolls, swelling the income of that very business-like
ecclesiastic and his successors for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>At the Highgate end dues were collected on horned cattle,
among other things, and here originated the practice of being
initiated into the freedom of Highgate, <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>a mock
ceremonial founded upon Roman Catholic rites at the time of the
Reformation.&nbsp; For three hundred years this farcical
observance was continued at the tavern by the gate, and only fell
into disuse with the decay of coaching.&nbsp; Those who had not
previously passed this way were &ldquo;sworn in on the
horns,&rdquo; a practice traced to the unwillingness of the
cattle drovers who frequented the tavern to allow strangers to
mix with them.&nbsp; This exclusiveness no doubt originated in
the fear of trade secrets being divulged, a feeling which may
still be met with among commercial travellers of the older
school, who resent the appearance of the mere tourist in their
midst.&nbsp; The stranger who in olden times happened upon these
drovers at Highgate was discouraged from taking bite or sup here,
and only permitted to join them after having kissed the horns of
one of their beasts.&nbsp; This speedily became elevated (or
degraded, shall we say?) into a sort of blasphemous ritual
parodying the admission of a novice into the Church, and this
again, with the lapse of time and the dying of religious hatreds,
developed into the merely good-natured farce played during the
last hundred years of the existence of the custom.</p>
<p>When the coaches pulled up here, it was soon discovered, by
judicious questioning, who were the strangers who had not been
made &ldquo;free.&rdquo;&nbsp; They were made to alight, and,
having removed their hats and kissed a pair of horns mounted on a
pole, &ldquo;the oath&rdquo; was administered by the landlord in
this wise:&mdash;&ldquo;Upstanding and uncovered: silence.&nbsp;
Take notice what I now say to you, for <i>that</i> is the first
word of the oath; mind <i>that</i>.&nbsp; You must acknowledge me
to be your adopted father.&nbsp; I must acknowledge you to be my
adopted son.&nbsp; If you do not call me father you forfeit a
bottle of wine; if I do not call you son I forfeit the
same.&nbsp; And now, my good son, if you are travelling through
this village of Highgate, and you have no money in your pocket,
go call for a bottle of wine at any house you may think proper <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>to enter and
book it to your father&rsquo;s score,&rdquo; and so forth.</p>
<p>An initiate had to swear never to drink small beer when he
could get strong (unless he preferred small); never to eat brown
bread when he could get white (unless he preferred brown); never
to kiss the maid when he could kiss the mistress (unless he
preferred the maid, and in case of doubt he might kiss both);
after which he had to kiss the horns or the woman in the company
who appeared the fairest, as seemed good to him, the ceremony
concluding with the declaration of his privileges as a freeman of
Highgate.&nbsp; Among the well-known privileges were&mdash;that
if he felt tired when passing through Highgate and saw a pig
lying in a ditch, he might kick the pig away and take its place,
but if he saw three lying together he must only kick away the
middle one and lie between the other two!</p>
<h2>X</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was on Highgate Hill that the
great Francis, Lord Bacon, whom some believe to have written
Shakespeare&rsquo;s dramas, fell a martyr to his scientific
enthusiasm.&nbsp; Driving up this chilly eminence one
winter&rsquo;s day when the snow lay on the ground, it occurred
to him that, from its chemical constituents, snow must possess
admirable preservative properties, and he accordingly resolved
immediately to put this theory to the proof.&nbsp; Stopping his
carriage at a neighbouring farmhouse, he purchased a fowl and
stuffed it carefully with snow.&nbsp; Being in weak health at the
time, he took a chill, and before he could be driven home, became
so alarmingly ill that he was obliged to be carried to Lord
Arundel&rsquo;s house at Highgate.&nbsp; There a damp bed
aggravated his seizure, so that in a few days he died, in
1626.</p>
<p>Farmhouses are far to seek from Highgate Hill nowadays, new
roads and streets of shops being more <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>general.&nbsp; With the end of the
eighteenth century, Highgate became a populous little town, but
its outskirts did not altogether lose their terrors for
travellers.&nbsp; Suburban villas had begun to sparsely dot these
northern heights of London with the coming of the new era, but
the New Police had not yet been brought into being; and so
belated dwellers in these wilds afforded fine sport for the
footpads, who, hunting in couples, and armed with horrible
pitch-plasters, attacked the mild citizen from behind, and,
clapping a plaster over his mouth, reduced him to an enforced
silence, while they emptied his pockets at leisure.&nbsp; It was
late one night in 1807 that Grimaldi, the most famous of all
clowns, was robbed on Highgate Hill by two footpads.&nbsp; They
spared him the usual plaster, perhaps because there was no one
else about, and so it did not matter in the least how loudly he
might shout for help.&nbsp; Among minor articles of spoil, they
secured a remarkable watch which had been given him two years
before as a testimonial by his many admirers.&nbsp; The dial
represented his face in character when singing his popular comic
song, &ldquo;Me and my Neddy.&rdquo;&nbsp; The robbers, seeing
this, immediately recognised him.&nbsp; Looking at one another,
they could not make up their minds to rob him of his treasure,
and so they gave it back, Grimaldi goggling and grinning at them
the while, as on the stage.&nbsp; So, with a vivid recollection
of Sadler&rsquo;s Wells, and bursting with laughter, they left
him.</p>
<p>It is peculiarly unfortunate for those who are uncertain about
their aspirates that London and its neighbourhood should abound
in place-names beginning with the letters &ldquo;A&rdquo; and
&ldquo;H.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cockneys have ever&mdash;or &rsquo;ave
hever, shall we say?&mdash;been afflicted with this difficulty;
but they are overcoming the tendency of their forbears to speak
of &ldquo;&rsquo;Ornsey, &rsquo;Ampstead, &rsquo;Igit,
&rsquo;Arrow, &rsquo;Omerton, &rsquo;Ackney, &rsquo;Endon or
&rsquo;Atfield.&rdquo;&nbsp; The classic anecdote in this
connection is that of the City Alderman who lived at Highgate,
praising his locality to a distinguished guest at a Mayoral
banquet.</p>

<p>Until 1813 coaches and foot-passengers alike toiled over the
Hill, through Highgate village, and by a roundabout road into
East End, Finchley, which, with its adjoining hamlets, was until
quite recently so greatly cut off from London by these
comparatively Alpine heights and the lack of suburban railways,
that it was, for all practical purposes, as distant as many other
places fifty or sixty miles away, but situated on more level
roads or on direct railway routes.&nbsp; To remedy this the
Archway Road was cut direct from the Upper Holloway Road to East
End, saving half a mile in the distance to be travelled and a
hundred feet in the height to be climbed.</p>
<p>The Archway and the Archway Road were constructed about 1813,
following upon the failure of the original idea of driving a
tunnel through the hill-top.&nbsp; The Hill is a great
outstanding knob of London clay, a substance both difficult and
dangerous to pierce; but it was not until the work was nearly
completed that it fell in, one day in 1812, happily before the
labours of the day had been begun.&nbsp; The present open cutting
of the Archway Road, rather over a mile in length, took the place
of the projected tunnel, and the Archway was constructed for the
purpose of carrying Hornsey Lane across the gap.&nbsp; If an
unlovely, it was in its way an impressive, structure, even though
the impression was, rather of the nightmare sort.&nbsp; It was
scarcely necessary, for Hornsey Lane has been at no time a place
of great resort, and the traffic along it could have been
diverted at small cost, and with little inconvenience made to
cross the Archway Road by a circuitous route.&nbsp; Highgate
Archway has now disappeared, giving place to a lighter structure,
spanning the road without the support of the cumbrous old piers
which, until the summer of 1900, continued to block three-fourths
of <a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>the
way.&nbsp; It has gone because the road-traffic has grown with
the suburbs and the way was not wide enough; but its
disappearance removes a landmark proclaiming where town and
country met.</p>
<p>The making of the Archway and the road was no public-spirited
act, but the commercial undertaking of a Company, whose total
expenses were very large, and, by consequence, the tolls exacted
extremely high.&nbsp; Pedestrians were not chargeable at ordinary
toll-gates, but here they had to pay a penny, or go the tedious
way over the Hill.&nbsp; Sixpence was levied on every laden or
draught horse.</p>
<p>It was not a profitable undertaking, even at these rates, and
the tolls had a very decided effect in stemming the advance of
Suburbia in this direction.&nbsp; In 1861, when the abolition of
tolls within fifty miles of London was a burning question, the
Company owed the Consolidated Fund no less than
&pound;13,000.&nbsp; The Government bought it out for
&pound;4,000, receiving &pound;9,000 by instalments spread over
fifteen years, after which period the road was to be declared
free.&nbsp; It was accordingly opened free of toll in 1876.&nbsp;
And thus it remained, as in the illustration, until 1897, when it
was demolished and the roadway widened.&nbsp; The present Archway
was opened in 1900.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">East</span> End, Finchley, to which we now
come, is one of the many straggling settlements built upon
Finchley Common.&nbsp; Stretches of fields alternate with rows of
new shops and tiny old-world cottages.&nbsp; Here stands the
&ldquo;Bald-Faced Stag,&rdquo; with the effigy of a stag
surmounting the appropriately bald elevation of that huge and
ugly public-house.&nbsp; The yards of monumental masons jostle it
on either hand; a grim and unpleasing conjunction, and a prelude
to those vast townships of <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>London&rsquo;s dead, the St.
Marylebone, Islington, and St. Pancras Cemeteries, which with
other properties of the Cemetery Companies render the road dismal
and people these northern heights with a vast population of
departed citizens.&nbsp; The merry market-gardener has betaken
himself and his cabbages to other parts, and the builder builds
but sparely.</p>
<p>Just where the Great Northern Railway bridge crosses over the
road at East End stands the &ldquo;Old White Lion,&rdquo; in a
pretty wooded dip of the road.&nbsp; The house was once known,
and marked on the maps as the &ldquo;Dirt House,&rdquo; from its
having been the house of call of the market-wagons on the way to
London with produce, and on the way back with loads of dirt and
manure.&nbsp; The wood was also known as &ldquo;Dirt House
Wood.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was here also that Horne the
coachmaster&rsquo;s stables were situated.</p>
<p>To this succeeds North Finchley, beginning at the junction of
a road from Child&rsquo;s Hill with the Great North Road, known
as Tally Ho Corner.&nbsp; North Finchley, called by the genteel
&ldquo;Torrington Park,&rdquo; is yet another settlement,
filched, like the cemeteries, from Finchley Common by successive
iniquitous Acts of Parliament at the beginning of the nineteenth
century.&nbsp; Could the gay highwaymen who, a hundred years ago,
were gathered to their fathers at the end of a rope down Tyburn
way revisit Finchley, the poor fellows would sadly need a
guide.&nbsp; Where, alas! is Finchley Common, that wide-spreading
expanse of evil omen on which these jovial spirits were so
thoroughly at home?&nbsp; Finchley Common, once second only to
the far-famed Hounslow Heath, has long since been divided up
between the many who, more than a hundred years ago, conspired to
cheat the people of their birthright in this once broad expanse
of open space.&nbsp; The representatives of the people at
Westminster allowed it, and my Lord Bishop of London profited by
it, together with lesser folk, each in their several
degrees.&nbsp; The Common then extended to considerably over two
thousand acres.&nbsp; Of this vast <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>tract only a few acres are left,
beyond North Finchley.&nbsp; The rest was sold quietly, and by
degrees, for absurdly small sums.</p>

"The Great Common of Finchley: a parlous place"

"The Great Common of Finchley: a parlous place"

</a></p>
<p>Between 1700 and 1800 the great Common of Finchley was a
parlous place, and not one of the better-known highwaymen but had
tried his hand at &ldquo;touching the mails&rdquo; as they went
across this waste; or patrolled the darkest side of the road,
ready to spring upon the solitary traveller.&nbsp; Indeed, the
childlike simplicity of the lonely travellers of those days is
absolutely contemptible, considering the well-known dangers of
the roads.&nbsp; For instance, on the night of the 28th August,
1720, a horseman might have been observed in the act of crossing
Finchley Common.&nbsp; He had fifteen guineas in his pocket, and
ambled along as though he had been in Pall Mall instead of on
perhaps the most dangerous road in England.&nbsp; At a respectful
distance behind him came his servant, and just in front of him,
midway of this howling wilderness, stood three figures.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is an eye that notes our coming,&rdquo; says the
poet, and three pairs of eyes had perceived this wayfarer.&nbsp;
They belonged to an enterprising individual named Spiggott and to
two other ruffians, whose names have not been handed down to
posterity.&nbsp; The weirdly named Spiggott was apparently above
disguising himself; his companions, however, might have stood for
stage brigands, for one of them had the cape of his coat buttoned
over his chin, and the other wore a slouched hat over his
eyes.&nbsp; In addition to this, he kept the ends of his long wig
in his mouth&mdash;which seems rather a comic opera touch.&nbsp;
It is to be hoped, rather than expected, that the traveller with
the guineas saw the humour of it.&nbsp; In the twinkling of an
eye one brigand had seized his horse and made him dismount, while
the others covered him with their pistols.&nbsp; The servant also
was secured, the guineas transferred with the dexterity of a
practised conjurer, the horses turned loose, and then the three
rode away, leaving the traveller and his servant to get on as
best they <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>could.&nbsp; Spiggott eventually paid the penalty of his
rashness in not disguising himself in accordance with the canons
of the hightoby craft, for when, a little later in his career, he
was caught, with some others, in an attempt on the Wendover wagon
at Tyburn, he was identified by the Finchley traveller.&nbsp; The
end of him was the appointed end of all his kind.&nbsp; The moral
of this story seems to be &ldquo;Wear a mask when engaged in
crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1774, Edmund Burke, travelling to Malton, in Yorkshire, was
stopped here by two highwaymen, who robbed him of ten guineas,
and his servant of his watch, in the most easy way.&nbsp; Some of
these highwaymen were, indeed, persons who took their calling in
an earnest and whole-hearted manner, and doubtless regarded Jack
Sheppard as a mere scatterbrain, quite unfitted to be in business
for himself.&nbsp; Thoroughly business-like men were Messrs.
Everett and Williams, who entered into a duly drawn and properly
attested deed of partnership, by which it was agreed that they
should work together on Finchley Common and elsewhere and divide
the profits of their labours into equal shares.&nbsp; Their
industry prospered, and the common fund soon reached the very
respectable total of &pound;2,000.&nbsp; But when required to
render accounts and to pay over half this amount, Mr. Williams
refused; whereupon his partner brought an action-at-law against
him, in 1725.&nbsp; A verdict for &pound;20 was actually
obtained, and appealed against by the defendant.&nbsp; The court
then very properly found the matter scandalous, and sentenced
Everett to pay costs, the solicitors engaged on either side being
fined &pound;50 each for their part in this discreditable
affair.&nbsp; One partner was executed, two years later, at
Maidstone, and the other at Tyburn, in 1730.</p>
<p>There still exists an ancient oak by the road at a place
called Brown&rsquo;s Wells, at the corner of a lane nearly
opposite the &ldquo;Green Man,&rdquo; and in the trunk of this
last survival of the &ldquo;good old days&rdquo; there have been
found, from time to time, quite a number of <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>pistol
bullets, said to have been fired by passing travellers at the
trunk to frighten the highwaymen who might chance to be hiding
behind it, under cover of the night.&nbsp; The tree itself has
long borne the name of Turpin&rsquo;s Oak, no less celebrated a
person than the re-doubtable Dick himself having once frequented
it.&nbsp; History fails to inform us who was the Brown after whom
the Wells were named.&nbsp; I suggest they should be, and were in
the first place &ldquo;Brent Wells&rdquo;; a source of the river
Brent.&nbsp; Nor are those Wells&mdash;whatever they may have
been&mdash;now in existence, while the name itself is only
perpetuated by two or three old stuccoed villas beside the
road.</p>

<img class='floatright' alt=

</a>Turpin, of course, is the greatest of all the rascals who
made the name of the Great North Road a name of dread.&nbsp;
Before him, however, the redoubtable Jack Sheppard figured here,
but not, it is sad to relate, in an heroic manner.&nbsp; In fact
that nimble-fingered youth, after escaping from the Stone Jug (by
which piece of classic slang you are to understand Newgate to be
meant) had the humiliation to be apprehended on Finchley Common,
disguised in drink and a butcher&rsquo;s blue smock.&nbsp; That
was the worst of those roystering blades.&nbsp; The drink was the
undoing of them all.&nbsp; If only they had been Good Templars,
and had sported the blue ribbon, it is quite certain that they
had not been cut off untimely; and might, with reasonable luck,
even have retired with a modest competence in early years.&nbsp;
It was in 1724 that Jack Sheppard was arrested by Bow Street
runners on the Common, and <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>the fact somewhat staggers
one&rsquo;s belief in the wild lawlessness of that place.&nbsp;
To capture a highwayman in his own peculiar territory!&nbsp; One
might just as soon expect to hear of the Chief Commissioner of
Police being kidnapped from Scotland Yard.&nbsp; And yet it is
quite certain that Finchley was no safe place for a good young
man with five pounds in his pocket and a mere walking-stick in
his hand, whether he proposed to cross it by night or day.&nbsp;
Even sixty-six years later this evil reputation existed; for, in
1790, the Earl of Minto, travelling to London, wrote to his wife
that instead of pushing on to town at night, he would defer his
entry until morning, &ldquo;for I shall not trust my throat on
Finchley Common in the dark.&rdquo;&nbsp; Think of it!&nbsp; And
Dick Turpin had been duly executed fifty years before!</p>
<p>Of the many names in the long and distinguished roll of road
agents who figured here at some time or another in their meteoric
careers, it is not possible to say much.&nbsp; There was the
courageous and resourceful Captain Hind, the whimsically
nicknamed &ldquo;Old Mob,&rdquo; burly Tom Cox, Neddy Wicks, and
Claud Duval.&nbsp; Duval&rsquo;s proper territory is, however,
the Bath Road.</p>
<p>The palmy days of the highwayman were before 1797, the year of
Pitt&rsquo;s Act for Restricting Cash Payments.&nbsp; Before
then, travellers carried nothing but gold, and as they required
plenty of that commodity on their long and tedious journeys, the
booty seized by these gentry was often considerable.&nbsp; Bank
notes then came into favour, and were issued for as low a
denomination as one pound.&nbsp; These would have been a perilous
kind of plunder, and accordingly as they grew popular, so did the
certainty of a good haul from coaches and post-chaises diminish,
until panics came, banks failed, and paper money became for a
time a discredited form of currency.&nbsp; By that time the roads
were better patrolled, and coin was to be conjured from the
pockets of the lieges with less safety than before.&nbsp; From
these causes, and from the new law <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>which made it penal to receive stolen
goods as well as to steal them, we may date the decadence of a
great industry, now utterly vanished from the roads.</p>

"&ldquo;The Whetstone&rdquo;"
 src="images/p72.jpg" />
</a><span class="smcap">Whetstone</span>, coming next after the
Finchleys, is held in local legends to have acquired its name
from the battered old stone still to be seen embedded in the
ground by the signpost of the &ldquo;Griffin&rdquo; inn.&nbsp; On
it the men-at-arms are said to have whetted their swords and
spears before the battle of Barnet.&nbsp; The sceptical smile at
this antiquity, and for their benefit there is a rival legend
which gives the date as that of 1745, when King George&rsquo;s
army marched down to meet Prince Charles and his
Highlanders.&nbsp; Antiquaries have often demolished this
derivation of the place-name; but the hoary (and quite
unveracious) tale survives, and is doubtless immortal.&nbsp; You
may explain it away, but the stone is there, and your local
patriot is ever a materialist in such a resort.</p>
<p>It is a straggling, broad-streeted village, with a breadth
implying the originally small value of the land, and
encroachments here and there upon the old building-line proving
both the implication and the fact that, many years ago, there
were those who, having the foreknowledge of a coming betterment,
<a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>and more
daring than their neighbours, grabbed while they might.&nbsp;
Many inns, laundries, dairy-farms, great black-timbered barns,
and a few rotting hoardings and unfinished houses make up the
long street and tell alike of a vanished rusticity and of an
arrested development.</p>
<p>Chaplin, the great coach-proprietor, had large stables here,
his first stage out of London on the northern roads.&nbsp; They
were placed here, rather than at Barnet, in order to avoid
expenses at Whetstone Gate, situated down the road, near
Greenhill Cross.&nbsp; Whetstone Gate gave travellers going north
the welcome intelligence that they had finally passed Finchley
Common and come to the better roads and more reputable society of
Barnet, where they were safe from highwaymen.</p>
<p>The road across Finchley Common was in passive alliance with
these gentry.&nbsp; When Pepys visited Barnet, in 1660, partly
for sake of its now forgotten medicinal waters, he found the
highway &ldquo;torne, plowed, and digged up,&rdquo; in
consequence of the heavily laden wagons and their long struggling
teams of horses and oxen, which had made havoc with what had been
a fairly good roadway.&nbsp; Progress was difficult, even in the
best circumstances, and when stress of weather made it almost
impossible, the highwaymen robbed with impunity, and absolutely
at their leisure.</p>
<p>The road remained more or less in this condition up to the
early years of the nineteenth century.&nbsp; This was partly
owing to the mistaken local patriotism which had prevented the
remodelling of it in 1754, when the rustics of Whetstone routed
the surveyor and his labourers at the point of the
pitchfork.&nbsp; Better counsels prevailed in the first decade of
the new era, and the eight miles of highway under the control of
the Whetstone and Highgate Turnpike Trust rose in 1810 to be
considered as good as any in the kingdom.&nbsp; It then became
possible, for the first time in its history, for the Barnet stage
to leave for London and to reach <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>its destination without the necessity
of stopping on the way for tea.&nbsp; The Trustees were naturally
pleased with their road, and so in 1823 received with some
surprise, under the new Act for the improvement of the line of
road from London to Holyhead, a demand for the reconstruction of
the highway between Prickler&rsquo;s Hill and the southern end of
Barnet town.&nbsp; They pointed out how greatly superior their
portion of the road was to others, but to no purpose.&nbsp; The
Government admitted the excellence of the surface, but boggled at
the severity of the gradient, and practically insisted on its
being reduced.</p>
<p>The Trustees were dismayed.&nbsp; Telford and Macadam supplied
rival plans, and both foreshadowed heavy expense.&nbsp;
Telford&rsquo;s idea was to slice off the top of Barnet Hill, and
to run the road through a more or less deep cutting through the
street; a plan which, if adopted, would have left the houses and
the footpaths in the position of buildings overhanging a
cliff.&nbsp; Fortunately for Barnet the scheme drawn up by
Macadam prevailed.&nbsp; It was for the partial filling up of the
dip in the road between Prickler&rsquo;s Hill and the excessively
steep entrance into the town, an entrance even now by no means
easily graded.&nbsp; What it must originally have been may
readily be judged by looking down from the present embanked road
to the old one, seen going off to the left, in the hollow where
the old roadside houses still stand, among them the &ldquo;Old
Red Lion,&rdquo; on the site of the inn where Pepys stayed.&nbsp;
The end one of a row of ten or twelve cottages, at the corner of
May&rsquo;s Lane, was once a toll-house.</p>
<p>The work of making the new road, begun in 1823, was not
completed until four years later, at a cost of
&pound;17,000.&nbsp; A large portion of this heavy sum went in
compensation to the Sons of the Clergy Corporation, for land
taken.&nbsp; The cost of these improvements came eventually, of
course, out of the pockets of travellers along the road.&nbsp; On
this Trust they were mulcted severely, for the Trustees, finding
the existing tolls to be utterly inadequate to their expenses,
obtained <a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>powers in 1830 to increase them.&nbsp; They considered
themselves hardly treated in being obliged to undertake such
costly works on the eve of the London and Birmingham Railway
being constructed&mdash;a railway which would have the effect of
withdrawing traffic from the road, and reducing receipts at the
toll-gates to a minimum; but the end, although not far off, was
not yet, and on the 3rd of July they succeeded in letting the
tolls by auction for one year at the handsome sum of
&pound;7,530.&nbsp; Accordingly they commenced to pay off their
debts, and succeeded in liquidating the whole of them by the
beginning of 1842, notwithstanding two successive reductions of
tolls in 1835 and 1841.</p>
<p>It was in 1833 that the London and Birmingham Railway obtained
its Act, and it was opened throughout on September 7, 1838, the
first of the railways which were to contribute to the ruin of
Barnet&rsquo;s great coaching and posting trade.&nbsp; The annual
takings at Whetstone Gate immediately fell to &pound;1,300, but
it lingered on until the Trust expired, November 1, 1863.</p>
<p>It is interesting, as showing the growth of road traffic, to
compare the figures still available, giving the annual sums at
which the tolls at this gate were let in the old days.&nbsp;
Thus, in Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s time, they were farmed at
&pound;40 per annum, and in 1794 they fetched only
&pound;150.&nbsp; But few vehicles passed then.&nbsp; Forty years
later, no fewer than ninety coaches swept through Whetstone Gate
every twenty-four hours!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Barnet</span>, or Chipping Barnet, or High
Barnet, as it is variously called, stands on the summit of a
steep and high ridge running east and west.&nbsp; On the east the
height of Muswell Hill, now suburban and crowned conspicuously
with that unfortunate place of entertainment, the Alexandra
Palace, is prominent; and on the west are Totteridge and the
range of hills stretching <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>away to Elstree.&nbsp; Other Barnets,
old and new, are plentiful: East and Friern Barnet, and the
modern suburb of New Barnet.&nbsp; Chipping Barnet derives the
first part of its name from its ancient chepe, or weekly market,
granted by Henry the Second, and its more common prefix of
&ldquo;High,&rdquo; from its situation on the ridge just
mentioned.</p>
<p>Barnet was, to many coaching proprietors, the first stage out
of London, and the town prospered exceedingly on the coaching and
posting traffic of those two great thoroughfares&mdash;the Great
North Road and the Holyhead Road.&nbsp; When the Stamford
&ldquo;Regent,&rdquo; the York &ldquo;Highflyer,&rdquo; and the
early morning coaches for Shrewsbury, Birmingham, Manchester, or
Liverpool arrived, the passengers, who had not found time for
breakfast before starting, were generally very sharp-set indeed,
and the viands already prepared and waiting in the cosy rooms of
the old hostelries, disappeared before their onslaught &ldquo;in
less than no time.&rdquo;&nbsp; The battle of Barnet was fought
over again every morning, but they were not men-at-arms who
contended together, nor was the subject of their contention the
Crown of England.&nbsp; They were just famished travellers who
struggled to get something to eat and drink before the guard made
his appearance at the door, with the fateful cry,
&ldquo;Time&rsquo;s up, gentlemen; take your seats
please.&rdquo;&nbsp; When the horn sounded in the yard, desperate
men would rush forth with hands full of food, and finish their
repasts as best they might on the coach.</p>

<p>The two principal inns were the &ldquo;Red Lion&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Green Man.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was, and is now in some degree,
a town of inns, but these were the headquarters of the two great
political parties.&nbsp; Neither was a &ldquo;coaching&rdquo;
inn, for they despised trafficking with ordinary travellers, and
devoted themselves wholly to the posting business.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Red Lion&rdquo; was originally the
&ldquo;Antelope.&rdquo;&nbsp; Standing in the most favourable
position for intercepting the stream of post-chaises from London,
it generally secured the pick <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>of business going that way, unless
indeed the political bias of gentlemen going down into the
country forbade them to hire post-horses at a Tory house.&nbsp;
In that case, they went to the &ldquo;Green Man,&rdquo; further
on, which was Whig.&nbsp; And perhaps, in sacrificing to
politics, they got inferior horses!&nbsp; The &ldquo;Green
Man&rdquo; placed in midst of the town, was in receipt of the up
traffic, and was the largest establishment, keeping twenty-six
pairs of horses and eleven postboys, against the eighteen pairs
and eight postboys of the &ldquo;Red Lion&rdquo;; and it is
recorded that between May 9th and 11th, when, on May 10th, 1808,
two celebrated prizefighters, Gully and Gregson, fought at
Beechwood Park, Sir John Sebright&rsquo;s place down the road,
near Flamstead, no fewer than one hundred and eighty-seven pairs
were changed.&nbsp; Those three days formed a record time for the
&ldquo;Green Man,&rdquo; according to these figures:&mdash;</p>

blue jackets; those of the &ldquo;Red Lion,&rdquo; yellow jackets
and black hats.</p>
<p>An inn called the &ldquo;Green Man&rdquo; stands on the site
of that busy house, but it is of more recent date than the old
Whig headquarters.&nbsp; It may be seen at the fork of roads
where the &ldquo;new&rdquo; road to St. Albans, driven through
the yard of the old &ldquo;Green Man&rdquo; in 1826, branches
off.</p>
<p>Thus the &ldquo;Red Lion&rdquo; remains, long after the
eclipse of its rival.&nbsp; Its frontage is impressive by size
rather than beauty.&nbsp; With a range of fifteen windows in
line, and its fiercely-whiskered red lion balancing himself at
the end of a prodigiously long wrought-iron sign, it is eloquent
of the old days.&nbsp; The lion turns his <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>head north,
gazing away from the direction in which his chief customers
came.</p>
<p>But this white-stuccoed frontage does not hide anything of
antiquity, for this is not that original &ldquo;Red Lion&rdquo;
to which Samuel Pepys resorted.&nbsp; The house he refers to in
his diary is the &ldquo;Old Red Lion&rdquo;; down the hill, at
the approach to Barnet.&nbsp; There he &ldquo;lay&rdquo; in
1667.&nbsp; &ldquo;August 11th, Lord&rsquo;s Day,&rdquo; he
writes: &ldquo;Up by four o&rsquo;clock . . . and got to the
wells at Barnet by seven o&rsquo;clock, and there found many
people a-drinking.&rdquo;&nbsp; After &ldquo;drinking three
glasses and the women nothing,&rdquo; the party sojourned
&ldquo;to the Red Lion, where we &rsquo;light and went up into
the great room, and there drank, and ate some of the best
cheesecakes that ever I ate in my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The keenness of the innkeepers who let post-horses during the
last few years of the coaching age is scarcely credible.&nbsp; It
was a fierce competition.&nbsp; The landlord of the &ldquo;Red
Lion&rdquo; at Barnet thought nothing of forcibly taking out the
post-horses from any private carriage passing his house, and
putting in a pair of his own, to do the next stage to St.
Albans.&nbsp; This, too, free of charge, in order to prevent the
business going to the hated rival.&nbsp; Mine host of that hotel
also had his little ways of drawing custom, and gave a glass of
sherry and a sandwich, gratis, to the travellers changing
there.&nbsp; But things did not end here.&nbsp; The landlord of
the &ldquo;Red Lion,&rdquo; finding, perhaps, that the sherry and
sandwich at the &ldquo;Green Man&rdquo; was more attractive than
his method, engaged a gang of bruisers to pounce upon passing
chaises, and even to haul them out of his rival&rsquo;s
stable-yard.&nbsp; Evidently a man of wrath, this licensed
victualler!&nbsp; After several contests of this kind, the
authorities interfered.&nbsp; The combatants were bound over to
keep the peace, the punching of conks and bread-baskets, and the
tapping of claret ceased, and people travelling down the road
were actually allowed to decide for themselves which house they
would patronise!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> Barnet the road runs across
Hadley Green, a broad and picturesque expanse, cursed nowadays
with the ubiquitous golfer.&nbsp; Here, where the road
divides&mdash;the Great North Road to the right and the old
Holyhead Road to the left&mdash;stands the obelisk known as
Hadley Highstone, which serves both as a milestone and as a
memorial of the great battle of Barnet, fought here on that cold
and miserable Easter Day, April 14, 1471, when Edward the Fourth
utterly defeated the Lancastrians under the Earl of Warwick, the
&ldquo;King Maker.&rdquo;&nbsp; Warwick fell, and the Red Rose
was finally crushed.&nbsp; Hadley Green was then a portion of a
wide stretch of unenclosed country known as Gladsmoor Heath,
extending up to Monken Hadley church, away on the right.&nbsp;
The obelisk was erected by Sir Jeremy Sambrooke in 1740 on the
spot where Warwick is said to have been slain.&nbsp; There is,
however, another spot which aspires to the honour, at Rabley
Park, near South Mimms.&nbsp; This also has its monumental
pillar, but without inscription.&nbsp; Among the guileless youth
of the neighbourhood it is said to mark &ldquo;the place where a
soldier was knocked down,&rdquo; which is a commonplace way of
stating the fact.&nbsp; But who knocked him down, or why, or
when, is beyond them when questioned.</p>
<p>Past the lodge gates of Wrotham Park and by Ganwick Corner,
where stands the &ldquo;Duke of York&rdquo; inn with its bust of
that wonderful strategist.&nbsp; He is looking enquiringly south,
from his alcove over the front door, as though wondering what has
become of all the post-chaises and coaches of old.&nbsp; He is
that great commander who managed, according to the well-known
rhyme, to march his ten thousand men to the top of a hill and
then down again&mdash;but he never otherwise distinguished
himself&mdash;except by the magnitude of his debts.</p>

<p>Potter&rsquo;s Bar marks where the counties of Middlesex and
Hertford join.&nbsp; It is not a place of delirious <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>delights,
consisting of stuccoed villas fondly supposed to be Italian, and
unfinished roads, and streets in a state of suspended
animation.&nbsp; Until 1897, when it was pulled down, an old
toll-house, the last in a long succession of toll-houses and
toll-bars which had stood here from the earliest times and had
given Potter&rsquo;s Bar its name, occupied the fork of the roads
at the north end of the village, commanding the high-road and the
road on the right to Northaw.&nbsp;

</a>&nbsp; It was not a beautiful building, but it hinted of old
times, and its disappearance is to be regretted.&nbsp; It was
taken down because already, in the first twelve months of the new
automobile era a car had dashed into it and done most of any
demolition necessary.&nbsp; A War Memorial now stands on the
site.&nbsp; Between this and Hatfield the road goes in undulating
fashion, with the Great Northern Railway on the left hand nearly
all the way, but chiefly downhill.&nbsp; Down Little Heath Hill
and then half-way up the succeeding incline we come to a cutting
which affords a newer and easier road than the hilly route to the
left.&nbsp;

onward, at Bell Bar, stands the pretty &ldquo;Swan&rdquo;

disappeared.&nbsp; Immediately ahead is Hatfield Park, stretching
away for over three miles.&nbsp; Through the park, by where the
present south lodge stands, the highway used to run in former
times, and brought wayfarers between the wind and the nobility of
the Cecils.&nbsp; Accordingly the road was diverted at the
instance of the then Lord Salisbury, and the public no longer
offend him, his heirs, executors, or assigns.&nbsp; And now, for
ever and a day, those who use the road between Potter&rsquo;s Bar
and Hatfield village must go an extra half mile.&nbsp; This is
indeed a free and happy country.</p>

<p>Hatfield village touches the extremity of wretchedness, just
as Hatfield House marks the apogee of late feudal
splendour.&nbsp; And yet, amid its tumbledown hovels there are
quaintly beautiful old-gabled cottages with bowed and
broken-backed red-tiled roofs, delightful to the artistic eye, if
from the builder&rsquo;s and decorator&rsquo;s point of view
sadly out of repair.&nbsp; Motor repair-shops and garages, with
their squalid <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>advertisements, have helped to ruin Hatfield, and the
railway does its share, running closely to the main road, and,
with the station directly opposite the highly elaborate modern
wrought-iron gates that lead to Hatfield House, detracting not a
little from that state of dignified seclusion by which, as we
have just seen, a former Marquis of Salisbury set such
store.&nbsp; Let us hope his pale ghost does not revisit his old
home.&nbsp; If it does, it must be sorely vexed.</p>
<p>But at any rate, that Marquis who was one of Queen
Victoria&rsquo;s Prime Ministers, sits there in bronze
portrait-effigy.&nbsp; He gazes mournfully, directly at the
railway booking-office, as one who has long been waiting, without
hope, for a train.&nbsp; It is a fine statue, by Sir George
Frampton, R.A., and bears the inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">ROBERT ARTHUR
TALBOT,<br />
Marquess of Salisbury, K.G., G.C.V.O.,<br />
Three times Prime Minister of<br />
Great Britain and Ireland,<br />
1830&ndash;1903.<br />
Erected to his memory by his Hertfordshire friends<br />
and neighbours in recognition of a great life devoted<br />
to the welfare of his country.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hatfield House, that great historical museum and ancient
repository of State secrets, is little seen from the village, nor
have we, as wayfarers along the road, much to do with it.&nbsp;
It is by the parish church, its characteristic Hertfordshire
extinguisher spire so prominent above the tumbled roofs of
Hatfield, that we may glimpse the older parts of the house.&nbsp;
In that church lies its builder, the great Robert Cecil, his
effigy, with the Lord Treasurer&rsquo;s wand of office, recumbent
on a slab uplifted by statues emblematic of Fortitude, Justice,
Prudence, and Temperance, and a skeleton below, to show that even
Lord Treasurers, possessed though they be of all the virtues, are
mortal, like less exalted and less virtuous men.</p>
<p>The house that he built seems sadly out of repair.&nbsp; The
history of it is romantic to a degree.&nbsp; Originally the
palace of the Bishops of Ely, whose delicate <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>constitutions
could not stand the fen-land vapours which enwrapped the
neighbourhood of their glorious Cathedral (but perhaps were not
harmful to the less dignified clergy!), it remained in their
possession until it was coveted by Henry the Eighth, who gave
some land at Ely in exchange.&nbsp; So the bishops had, doubtless
with an ill grace, to go back to that fertile breeding-ground of
agues and rheumatism, and one can well imagine the resident
inferior clergy, between their aches and pains, chuckling
secretly about this piece of poetic justice.</p>
<p>And so in Royal possession the old palace continued until
James the First in his turn exchanged it for the estate of Sir
Robert Cecil at Theobalds.&nbsp; Previously it had been the
home&mdash;the prison, rather of the Princess Elizabeth during
her sister Mary&rsquo;s reign.&nbsp; The oak is still shown in
the park under which she was sitting when the news of
Mary&rsquo;s death and the end, consequently, of the surveillance
to which she was subjected, was brought her, November 17,
1588.&nbsp; (But is tradition truthful here?&nbsp; Would she have
been sitting under an oak in November?)&nbsp; &ldquo;It is the
Lord&rsquo;s doing, it is marvellous in our eyes,&rdquo; she
exclaimed, quoting from the Psalms.&nbsp; Three days later she
held her first council in the old palace, and then on the 23rd
set out for London.</p>
<p>There are relics of the great queen at Hatfield House: a pair
of her stockings and the garden hat she was wearing when the
great news came to her.&nbsp; But the house is nearly all of a
later date, for when Sir Robert Cecil obtained it in exchange for
Theobalds, he pulled down the greater part of the old palace and
built the present striking Jacobean building, magnificent and
impressive, and perhaps not the less impressive for being also
somewhat gloomy.&nbsp; This is no place to recount the glories of
its picture-galleries and its noble state-rooms, or of the long
line of the exalted and the great who have been entertained
here.&nbsp; Moreover, the great are not uncommonly the dullest of
dull dogs.&nbsp; It is rather with those of less estate, <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>and with
travellers, that in these pages we shall find our account.&nbsp;
Pepys, for instance, whom we need not object to call the natural
man (for does not Scripture tell us that the human heart in a
natural state is &ldquo;desperately wicked&rdquo;? and Samuel was
no Puritan), who was here lusting to steal somebody&rsquo;s dog,
as he acknowledged in that very outspoken <i>Diary</i> of
his:&mdash;&ldquo;Would fain have stolen a pretty dog that
followed me, but could not, which troubled me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a tragical happening at Hatfield, November 27, 1835,
when the house was greatly injured by fire, and the old and
eccentric Dowager Marchioness of Salisbury burnt to death, in her
eighty-fifth year.&nbsp; The pious declared it to be a
&ldquo;judgment&rdquo; for her playing cards on Sunday; but what
a number of conflagrations we should have if that were true and
Providence consistent in its vengeance!</p>
<h2>XV</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Leaving</span> Hatfield and its memories
behind, we come, past the tree-shaded hamlet of Stanborough, to
the long gradual rise of Digswell Hill, beautifully engineered
over the uplands rising from the marshy banks of the little river
Lea.&nbsp; Off to the left, at the foot of the hill, goes the old
road at a wide tangent, and with a decidedly abrupt plunge down
into the water-meadows, crossing the Lea by Lemsford Mills, and
rejoining the newer road on an equally abrupt and difficult rise
half-way up the hill, by the wall of Brockett Hall Park.&nbsp; It
was here that Brickwall turnpike gate was situated in the old
days.&nbsp; The brick wall of the park that gave the gate its
name is still there and a very old, substantial, and beautifully
lichened red-brick wall it is&mdash;but the gate and the
toll-board and the toll-house have all vanished.&nbsp; Digswell
Hill is beautiful, and so is Ayot Green, at the summit, with its
giant trees and humble cottages stretching away on the left to
the Ayot <a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>villages.&nbsp; Not so the &ldquo;Red Lion&rdquo; close
by.&nbsp; More beautiful still&mdash;and steeper&mdash;is the
descent into Welwyn, beneath over-arching trees and rugged banks,
down from which secluded rustic summer-houses look upon the
traffic of the highway.</p>
<p>Welwyn lies in a deep hollow on the little river&mdash;or,
more correctly speaking, the streamlet&mdash;of the Mimram.&nbsp;
Street and houses face you alarmingly as you descend the steep
hillside, wondering (if you cycle) if the sharp corner can safely
be rounded, or if you must needs dash through door or window of
the &ldquo;White Hart,&rdquo; once one of the two coaching inns
of the village.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;White Hart&rdquo; at Welwyn was kept in the
&ldquo;twenties&rdquo; by &ldquo;old Barker,&rdquo; who horsed
the Stamford &ldquo;Regent&rdquo; a stage on the road, and was,
in the language of the coachmen, a &ldquo;three-cornered old
beggar.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is to say, he kept a tight hand over
the doings of coachmen and guards, did not approve of
&ldquo;shouldering,&rdquo; and objected to the coachmen giving
lessons to gentlemen coachmen, or allowing amateurs to
&ldquo;take the ribbons.&rdquo;&nbsp; From the passengers&rsquo;
point of view this was entirely admirable of &ldquo;old
Barker,&rdquo; for many an inoffensive traveller&rsquo;s life had
been jeopardised by the driving of unqualified persons.&nbsp;
Colonel Birch Reynardson tells a story of him and of Tom Hennesy,
the best known of the &ldquo;Regent&rdquo; coachmen&mdash;one who
could whistle louder, hit a horse harder, and tell a bigger lie
than any of his contemporaries.&nbsp; Hennesy had resigned the
reins to him one day between London and Hatfield, but when they
neared Welwyn, the accomplished Tom thought he had better resume
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would never do for old Barker to see you
driving,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; The words were scarcely out of his
mouth before the &ldquo;three-cornered old beggar&rdquo; himself
appeared, walking up the hill, with the double object of taking a
constitutional and of seeing if any &ldquo;shouldering&rdquo; was
going on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look as if you seed him,&rdquo; said
Tom.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make the best of it we
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a name="page89"></a><span

</a></p>
<p><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>Down
they went to the inn door, where the fresh team was
standing.&nbsp; By the time the horses had been got out of the
coach, old Barker, who had turned back, looking anything but
pleasant, was upon them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Barker, sir,&rdquo; said Tom, with
all the impudence he could command.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you ever see
a young gentleman take a coach steadier down a hill?&nbsp;
&rsquo;Pon my word, sir, he could not have done it better.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s a pupil of mine, sir, and I&rsquo;m blessed if he did
not do it capital; don&rsquo;t you think he did, sir, for you
seed him?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hum,&rdquo; said old Barker;
&ldquo;you know it&rsquo;s all against the laws.&nbsp; Supposing
anything happened, what then?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, sir, I
did not expect anything <i>would</i> happen, with such horses as
these of yours; there&rsquo;s no better four horses, sir, betwixt
London and Stamford; and as for those wheelers, why,
they&rsquo;ll hold anything.&rdquo;&nbsp; This, of course, was
pouring balm into old Barker&rsquo;s wounds, which seemed to heal
pretty quickly, and he put on a pleasanter face, and said,
&ldquo;Well, Hennesy, you know I don&rsquo;t like
&lsquo;gentlemen coachmen,&rsquo; and, above all things, very
<i>young</i> ones.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you do it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Was Hennesy grateful?&nbsp; Not at all; for, when they had
driven away, he said, &ldquo;Well, he was wonderful civil for
<i>him</i>,&rdquo; and added that if he could only catch him
lying drunk in the road, he would run over his neck and kill him,
&ldquo;blessed if he wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This bold and independent fellow, like many another coachman,
came down in the world when railways drove the coaches off the
main roads, and was reduced to driving a pair-horse coach between
Cambridge and Huntingdon.</p>
<p>More picturesque than the &ldquo;White Hart&rdquo; is the
&ldquo;Wellington,&rdquo; which composes so finely with the
red-brick tower of the church, at the further end of the village
street, where the road abruptly forks.&nbsp; It is a street of
all kinds and sizes of houses, mostly old and pleasingly
grouped.</p>
<p>But Welwyn has other claims upon the tourist.&nbsp; It was the
home for many years of Young, author <a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>of the once-popular <i>Night
Thoughts</i>.&nbsp; Who reads that sombre work now?&nbsp; He was
rector here from 1730 until 1765, when he died, but lives as a
warning to those who inevitably identify an author with his
books.&nbsp; His work, <i>The Complaint</i>, <i>or</i>, <i>Night
Thoughts on Life</i>, <i>Death</i>, <i>and Immortality</i>, is
dour reading, but he was so little of a sombre man that we find
him not infrequently in the company of, and a fellow spirit
among, the convivial men of his time.&nbsp; This was only a
product of his &ldquo;sensibility,&rdquo; that curious quality
peculiar to the eighteenth century, and did not necessarily prove
him a weeping philosopher.&nbsp; He had, indeed, a mental agility
which could with ease fly from the most depressing disquisitions
on the silent tomb, to the proper compounding of a stiff jorum of
punch.&nbsp; Young, on his appointment to Welwyn, married Lady
Elizabeth (&ldquo;Betty&rdquo;) Lee, daughter of the Earl of
Lichfield.&nbsp; He found the rectory too small (or perhaps not
good enough for her ladyship), and so purchased a more imposing
house called the &ldquo;Guessons&rdquo;&mdash;anciently the
&ldquo;Guest House&rdquo; of some abbey.&nbsp; With it he bought
land, and planted the lime-tree avenue which still remains a
memorial of him.&nbsp; There is a votive urn here, erected by Mr.
Johnes-Knight, a succeeding rector; but probably the most
enduring memorial of Young is the very first line of the <i>Night
Thoughts</i>, the fine expression:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Tired Nature&rsquo;s sweet restorer, balmy
sleep.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No one reads Young nowadays, and so every one who sees this,
one of the most hackneyed of quotations, ascribes it to
Shakespeare.&nbsp; Alas, poor Young!</p>
<p>Young erected a sundial in his garden here, with the motto,
&ldquo;<i>Eheu</i>, <i>fugaces</i>!&rdquo; &ldquo;Alas, how
fleeting!&rdquo;&nbsp; It was not long before some midnight
robbers came, and, carrying it off, justified the
inscription.&nbsp; Nowadays, besides the avenue and the votive
urn, all that remains to tell of him is the tablet to his memory
on the south wall of the aisle.</p>
<p><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>Knebworth Park, with mansion and an ancient parish
church full of monuments to Strodes, Robinsons and Lyttons, is
just off to the left.&nbsp; There is no Lytton blood in the Earls
&ldquo;of&rdquo; Lytton, who are not of Litton, near Tideswell,
in Derbyshire, whence came the now extinct Lytton family.&nbsp;
The whole assumption is romantic rather than warranted by
facts.</p>
<p>Knebworth is a place of much combined beauty and historic
interest, together with a great deal of vulgar and uninteresting
sham.&nbsp; It has been described as &ldquo;a sham-old house,
with a sham lake, sham heraldic monsters, and sham-ancient
portraits.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bulwer, the first Lord
Lytton&mdash;&ldquo;Bulwig,&rdquo; as someone, to his intense
annoyance, called him&mdash;was intensely fond of Gothic
architecture and ornamentation; fond of it in an
undiscriminating, Early Victorian, uninstructed way, and he stuck
his house of Knebworth all over with gimcrackery that he fondly
thought to be medi&aelig;val.&nbsp; Crockets, tourelles,
pinnacles and grotesque gargoyles were added in wholesale
fashion, and in a very carpenterish way.&nbsp; One might almost
say they were <i>wafered</i> on.&nbsp; They were not carved out
of stone, but moulded cheaply in plaster, and in his son&rsquo;s
time were always falling.&nbsp; As they fell, they were relegated
to the nearest dustheap, and their places remained vacant.&nbsp;
A visitor to the second Lord Lytton tells, apropos of these
things, how he was walking on the terrace with his host, when the
gardener came up and said, &ldquo;If you please, my lord, another
of them bloody monkeys has fallen down in the night.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It was, of course, one more of &ldquo;Bulwig&rsquo;s&rdquo;
quasi-Gothic abominations come to its doom.</p>
<p>The Earls Lytton are neither baronial Bulwers nor ancient
lordly Lyttons.&nbsp; Their real name is the very much more
plebian one of Wiggett.&nbsp; So far back as 1756, William
Wiggett assumed the name of Bulwer on his marriage with a Sarah
of that ilk.&nbsp; His youngest son, the novelist, the child of
another wife, who had been an Elizabeth Warburton, added the name
of Lytton to his own on succeeding to his mother&rsquo;s property
of Knebworth.</p>
<p><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>But
that does not at once bring us to the Lytton connection.&nbsp;
For that, we must quote the late Augustus J. C. Hare, who was an
adept at relationships to the remotest degree.&nbsp; He had
hundreds of cousins of his own, and knew who was everybody
else&rsquo;s twentieth or thirtieth cousin.&nbsp; He tells us
that this Elizabeth Warburton&rsquo;s very remote connection with
the real Lyttons lay in the fact that &ldquo;her grandfather,
John Robinson, was cousin (maternally) to Lytton Strode, who was
great-nephew of a Sir William Lytton, who died childless in
1704.&rdquo;&nbsp; It will be allowed that the connection
<i>is</i> remote; practically indeed, non-existent.</p>
<p>Nor is the name of Bulwer as distinguished as the novelist
wished it to appear.&nbsp; He sought to range it with
B&ouml;lver, one of the war-titles of the Norse god, Odin; but it
really derived from some plebian cattle-driver, or Bullward.</p>
<p>The road rises steeply out of Welwyn, in the direction of
Stevenage.&nbsp; Here some of the coaches had a narrow escape
from destruction at the hands of unknown miscreants, ancestors of
the criminal lunatics who place obstacles upon the railways in
our times.&nbsp; Our murderous larrikins had their counterparts
in the old days, in those who placed gates across the roads, so
that the coaches should run into them in the darkness.&nbsp; An
incident of this kind happened here on the night of June 5, 1805,
when two gates were found set up in the main road, and another at
Welwyn Green.&nbsp; Fortunately, no accident resulted, and the
ruffians, who doubtless were waiting the result of their work,
must have gone home disappointed.</p>
<p>From the beautiful expanse of gorsy and wooded hillside common
above the village may be glimpsed the great red-brick viaduct of
Welwyn, carrying the main line of the Great Northern Railway
across the wide and deep valley of the Mimram, an insignificant
stream for such a channel.&nbsp; Woolmer Green and Broadwater,
between this point and Stevenage, are modern and uninteresting
hamlets, created out of nothingness by the speculative builder
and the handy <a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>situation of Knebworth station, beside the road, which
now begins to give another example of its flatness.</p>
<p>Leisurely wayfarers will notice the old half-timbered cottage
at the entrance to the churchyard.&nbsp; On its side wall are
hung two stout long poles with formidable hooks attached.&nbsp;
These are old fire-appliances, used in the days of thatched
roofs, for pulling off the whole of the blazing thatch.&nbsp;
Travellers, leisured or otherwise, will scarce be able to miss
seeing the great and offensive boards hereabouts, advertising a
new suburban or &ldquo;Garden Suburb&rdquo; settlement in course
of building away to the right, since 1920; blessed and boomed by
Lord Northcliffe, and apparently to be given the name of
&ldquo;Daily Mail.&rdquo;&nbsp; Horrible!</p>
<p>The entrance to Stevenage is signalised by a group of new and
commonplace cottages elbowing the famous Six Hills, a series of
sepulchral barrows of prehistoric date, beside the highway.&nbsp;
These six grassy mounds might not unreasonably be passed
unthinkingly by the uninstructed, or taken for grass-grown heaps
of refuse.&nbsp; Centuries of wear and weather have had their
effect, and they do not look very monumental now; but they were
once remarkable enough to give the place its name, Stevenage
deriving from the Saxon &ldquo;<i>stigenhaght</i>,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;hills by the highway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To coachmen, who were adepts in the art of what the slangy
call &ldquo;spoofing,&rdquo; and were always ready&mdash;in
earlier slang phrase&mdash;to &ldquo;take a rise out of&rdquo;
strangers, the Six Hills afforded an excellent opportunity of
practising a diluted form of wit, and often brought them a glass
of brandy or rum-and-milk at the next pull-up, in payment of the
bets they would make with the most innocent-looking passenger,
that he could not tell which two of the hills were furthest
apart.&nbsp; They are, as nearly as possible, equi-distant; but
strangers would select one couple or another, according to their
fancy; whereupon the coachman would triumphantly point out that
the first and the last were, as a matter of fact, the most widely
divided.&nbsp; This <a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>perhaps does not exhibit coaching wit in a strikingly
robust light; but a very weak kind of jocularity served to pass
the weary hours of travel in our grandfathers&rsquo; days.</p>

<h2>XVI</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Stevenage</span> is the first of the many
wide-streeted towns and villages whose emptiness proclaims the
something missing that was provided for by all this vast
roominess.&nbsp; Its one street, lining the old road, was
originally laid out so spaciously for the purpose of affording
room for the traffic for which, once upon a time, it was not too
spacious.&nbsp; It is all too wide now that the intercourse of
two nations proceeds by rail, and many of the old inns that once
did so famous a trade are converted into private
residences.&nbsp; Prominent among them was the
&ldquo;Swan,&rdquo; which may now be sought in the large
red-brick house on the right-hand side of the forking roads, as
the town is left for Baldock.&nbsp; It may readily be identified
by its archway, which formerly led to the spacious stables.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Swan&rdquo; at Stevenage, kept in pre-railway days
by a postmaster named Cass, was one of those exclusive houses
which, like the &ldquo;Red Lion&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Green
Man&rdquo; at Barnet, did not condescend to the ordinary
coach-traveller.&nbsp; Cass kept post-horses only, and his
customers ranged from princes and dukes down to baronets and
wealthy knights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Posting in all its branches,&rdquo; as the postmasters
used to say in the announcements outside their establishments,
was at the beginning of the nineteenth century essentially
aristocratic; but it had many changes, from its beginning, about
the dawn of the seventeenth century, to its end, before the
middle of the nineteenth.&nbsp; Originally &ldquo;posting&rdquo;
meant the hire of horses only, and the traveller rode horseback
himself, accompanied perhaps by a mounted guide.&nbsp; <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>Thus Fynes
Morison, in his <i>Itinerary</i>, published in 1617, speaks of
the early days of posting:&mdash;&ldquo;In England, towards the
south, and in the west parts, and from London to Barwick upon the
confines of Scotland, post-horses are established at every ten
miles or thereabouts, which they ride a false gallop after some
ten miles an hour sometimes, and that makes their hire the
greater; for with a commission from the chief postmaster or
chiefe lords of the councell (given either upon publike
businesse, or at least pretence thereof), a passenger shall pay
twopence halfpenny each mile for his horse, and as much for his
guide&rsquo;s horse; but one guide will serve the whole company,
though many ride together, who may easily bring back the horses,
driving them before him, who &lsquo;know the waye as well as a
beggar knowes his dishe.&rsquo;&nbsp; This extraordinary charge
of horses&rsquo; hire may well be recompensed with the speede of
the journey, whereby greater expences in the innes are avoided;
all the difficultie is, to have a body able to endure the
toyle.&nbsp; For these horses the passenger is at no charge to
give them meat onely at the ten miles, and the boy that carries
them backe will expect some few pence in gift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When carriages were introduced, the very great personages of
the realm &ldquo;progressed&rdquo; in them, and had their love of
display gratified thereby.&nbsp; But what they gained in pomp
they lost in speed, for at the best of it they rarely travelled
at a greater pace than seven miles an hour.</p>
<p>An odd institution with the noble and the wealthy families of
that bygone age was the &ldquo;running footman.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
has sometimes been supposed that these deer-footed servitors were
for town service, perhaps because &ldquo;old Q,&rdquo; the
profligate Marquis of Queensberry, who was the last to keep one,
lived in town during his last years and necessarily kept his
lackey running London streets.&nbsp; The unique sign of the
&ldquo;running footman,&rdquo; with the portrait of such an one
in costume, is also in London, and may be seen any <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>day on a
little public-house, still chiefly frequented by men-servants, in
Charles Street, Berkeley Square.&nbsp; He wears a uniform
consisting of blue coat and breeches, trimmed with gold
lace.&nbsp; Round his waist is a red sash, on his head a cap with
a nodding plume, and in his hand the long staff carried by all
his tribe.&nbsp; This is an outfit somewhat different from that
usually worn, for we are told that they wore no breeches, but a
short silk petticoat kept down by a deep gold fringe.</p>
<p>The function of a running footman was to run ahead of his
employer&rsquo;s carriage, to point out the proper turnings to
take, or to arrange for his reception at the inns; but as time
went on and accommodation increased, he was not of any practical
use, and became simply a kind of unnecessary fore-runner, who by
his appearance advertised the coming of my lord and upheld my
lord&rsquo;s dignity.&nbsp; It is said that these ministers to
senseless pomp and vanity usually ran at the rate of seven miles
an hour, and frequently did sixty miles a day.&nbsp; The long and
highly ornamented staff they carried had a hollow silver ball at
the end containing white wine.&nbsp; Unscrewing it, the footman
could refresh himself.&nbsp; More white wine, mixed with eggs,
was given him at the end of his journey, and he must have needed
it!&nbsp; Over the bad and hilly roads of a hundred and fifty
years ago, the running footman could readily keep ahead of a
carriage; on the flat the horses, of course, had the
advantage.</p>
<p>Post-chaises were unknown in England until after the middle of
the eighteenth century had come and gone.&nbsp; Thus we find
Horace Walpole and Gray, taking the &ldquo;grand tour&rdquo;
together in 1739, astonished to laughter at the post-chaises
which conveyed them from Boulogne towards Paris.&nbsp; This
French vehicle, the father of all post-chaises, was two-wheeled,
and not very unlike our present hansom-cab, the door being in
front and the body hung in much the same way, only a little more
forward from the wheels.&nbsp; The French <i>chaise de-poste</i>
was invented in 1664, and the first used in England were of this
type; but they <a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>proved unsuitable for use in this country, and English
carriage-builders at length evolved the well-known post-chaise,
which went out only with the coaching age.&nbsp; But it was long
before it began to supplant the post-horses and the feminine
pillion.</p>
<p>Every one is familiar with the appearance of the old
post-chaise, which, according to the painters and the
print-sellers, appears to have been used principally for the
purpose of spiriting love-lorn couples with the speed of the wind
away from all restrictions of home and the Court of
Chancery.&nbsp; A post-chaise was (so it seems nowadays) a rather
cumbrous affair, four-wheeled, high, and insecurely hung, with a
glass front and a seat to hold three, facing the horses.&nbsp;
The original designers evidently had no prophetic visions as to
this especial popularity of post-chaises with errant lovers, nor
did they ponder the proverb, &ldquo;Two&rsquo;s company,
three&rsquo;s none,&rdquo; else they would have restricted their
accommodation to two, or have enlarged it to four.</p>
<p>It was an expensive as well as a pleasant method of
travelling, costing as it did at least a shilling a mile, and, in
times when forage was dear, one shilling and threepence.&nbsp;
The usual rates were chaise, nine-pence a mile, pair of
post-horses, sixpence; four horses and chaise, supposing you
desired to travel speedily&mdash;say at twelve miles an
hour&mdash;one-and-ninepence.&nbsp; But these costs and charges
did not frank the traveller through.&nbsp; The post-boy&rsquo;s
tip was as inevitable as night and morning.&nbsp; Likewise there
were the &ldquo;gates&rdquo; to pay every now and again.&nbsp;
One shudders to contemplate the total cost of posting from London
to Edinburgh, even with only the ordinary equipment of two
horses.&nbsp; There were thirty post-stages between the two
capitals, according to the books published for the use of
travellers a hundred years ago.&nbsp; Those books were very
necessary to any one who did not desire to be charged for perhaps
a mile more on each stage than it really measured, which was one
of those artful postmasters&rsquo; little ways.&nbsp; Here is a
list of these stages with the measurements, to <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>which
travellers drew the attention of those postmasters who commonly
endeavoured to overcharge:&mdash;</p>

<p>Nearly four hundred miles by these measurements.&nbsp; This,
at a shilling a mile for the posting, gives &pound;20; but,
including the postboys&rsquo; tips, &ldquo;gates,&rdquo; and
expenses at the inns on the road, the journey could not have been
done in this way under &pound;30, at the most modest
calculation.&nbsp; This list of post-stages was one drawn up for
distances chiefly between the towns, but nothing is more
remarkable along the Great North Road than the number of old
posting-houses which still exist (although of course their
business is gone) in wild and lonely spots, far removed from
either town or village.</p>
<p>Another &ldquo;branch&rdquo; of posting was the horsing alone,
by which a private carriage could be taken to or from town by
hiring posters at every stage.&nbsp; This was a favourite
practice with the gentry of the shires, who thus had all the
<i>&eacute;clat</i> of travelling in private state, without the
expense and trouble of providing their own horses.&nbsp; It is
probably of this method that De Quincey speaks in the following
passage:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In my childhood,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;standing with one or two of my brothers and sisters at the
front window <a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>of my mother&rsquo;s carriage, I remember one unvarying
set of images before us.&nbsp; The postillion (for so were all
carriages then driven) was employed, not by fits and starts, but
always and eternally, in quartering, <i>i.e.</i> in crossing from
side to side, according to the casualties of the ground.&nbsp;
Before you stretched a wintry length of lane, with ruts deep
enough to fracture the leg of a horse, filled to the brim with
standing pools of rain-water; and the collateral chambers of
these ruts kept from becoming confluent by thin ridges, such as
the Romans called <i>lirae</i>, to maintain the footing upon
which <i>lirae</i>, so as not to swerve (or as the Romans would
say, <i>delirare</i>), was a trial of some skill, both for the
horses and their postillion.&nbsp; It was, indeed, next to
impossible for any horse, on such a narrow crust of separation,
not to grow <i>delirious</i> in the Roman metaphor; and the
nervous anxiety which haunted me when a child was much fed by
this image so often before my eyes, and the sympathy with which I
followed the motion of the docile creatures&rsquo; legs.&nbsp; Go
to sleep at the beginning of a stage, and the last thing you
saw&mdash;wake up, and the first thing you saw&mdash;was the line
of wintry pools, the poor off-horse planting his steps with care,
and the cautious postillion gently applying his spur whilst
manoeuvring across the system of grooves with some sort of
science that looked like a gipsy&rsquo;s palmistry&mdash;so
equally unintelligible to me were his motions in what he sought
and in what he avoided.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> we leave Stevenage, we must
pay a visit to the &ldquo;Old Castle&rdquo; inn, in whose stable

<p>The inn-signs of Stevenage afford some exercise for the
contemplative mind.&nbsp; As the town is approached from London,
the sign of &ldquo;Our Mutual Friend&rdquo; appears, nearly
opposite a domestic Gothic building of red and white brick,
originally a home for decayed authors, founded by Charles Dickens
and the first Lord Lytton.&nbsp; The decayed authors did not take
kindly to the scheme.&nbsp; Perhaps they did not like being <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>patronised
by authors of better fortunes than their own.&nbsp; The
institution was a failure, and the building is now put to other
uses.&nbsp; No doubt the sign of &ldquo;Our Mutual Friend&rdquo;
derives from those times when Dickens and Lytton foregathered
here and at Knebworth.&nbsp; At quite the other end of the town
appears the obviously new sign of the &ldquo;Lord
Kitchener,&rdquo; almost opposite that of another military hero,
the &ldquo;Marquis of Granby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passing through the little old-world village of Graveley,
succeeded by the beautifully graded rise and fall of Lannock
Hill, we come into the town of Baldock, with its great church
prominent in front, and its empty streets running in puzzling
directions.&nbsp; It was at Baldock that Charles the First, being
conducted as a prisoner to London, was offered wine in one of the
sacramental vessels by the vicar, Josias Byrd, and it was on the
road outside the town, near where the old turnpike gate stood,
that the Newcastle wagon, on its way to London, was plundered of
&pound;500 in coin by three mounted highwaymen, on a February
morning in 1737.</p>
<p>Our old friend Mr. Samuel Pepys, journeying on August 6th,
1661, from Brampton, came into Baldock, and stayed the night, at
some inn not specified.&nbsp; He says, &ldquo;Took horse for
London, and with much ado got to Baldwick.&nbsp; There lay, and
had a good supper by myself.&nbsp; The landlady being a pretty
woman, but I durst not take notice of her, her husband being
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Always some spoil-sport in the way!</p>
<p>Baldock, from its stunted extinguisher spire to its fine old
brick houses and nodding plaster cottages, is characteristically
Hertfordshire.&nbsp; Among other things of general interest, it
has a row of almshouses, duly inscribed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Theis Almes
Howses are<br />
the gieft of Mr. John Wynne<br />
cittezen of London, Latelye<br />
Deceased, who hath left a<br />

<p><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>The
worthy citizen reckoned without the Charity Commissioners, who
may confidently be expected to propound a &ldquo;scheme&rdquo;
some day long anterior to the final crash, by which his wishes
will be entirely disregarded.</p>
<p>Away to the left of Baldock will be noticed a new town, and
the factory chimneys of it.&nbsp; This is Letchworth, the
&ldquo;Garden City,&rdquo; developed out of Letchworth, the
little village of old.&nbsp; This &ldquo;First Garden
City,&rdquo; founded in 1902, on a nominal capital of
&pound;300,000 actual &pound;125,000, by the Garden City
Association, itself founded in June, 1899, with a capital of
about thirty shillings, represents a passionate quest of the
ideal life on a 5 per cent. basis of profit.&nbsp; The problem of
how to create an earthly paradise (plus industrial factories) was
here to be tackled.&nbsp; The beginnings of such things are
always the most charming; and Letchworth began ideally.&nbsp; But
the factories and the five per cent. always have a way of
overcoming ideals; and we shall see.</p>

Topler&rsquo;s Hill, the Bedfordshire border is crossed.&nbsp; We
may perhaps be excused if we pass Topler&rsquo;s Hill
unwittingly, for the rises called &ldquo;hills&rdquo; on the
Great North Road would generally pass unnoticed elsewhere.&nbsp;
Biggleswade town and neighbourhood are interested wholly in
cabbages and potatoes and other highly necessary, but essentially
unromantic, vegetables.&nbsp; The surrounding country is in
spring and summer one vast market-garden; at other times it is
generally a lake of equal vastness, for the Ivel and the Ouse,
that run so sluggishly through the flat lands, arise then in
their might and submerge fields and roads for miles around.</p>
<p>As for Biggleswade itself, it is a town with an
extraordinarily broad and empty market-place, a church with a
spire of the Hertfordshire type, and two old coaching
inns&mdash;the &ldquo;White Swan&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Crown&rdquo;&mdash;facing one another in an aggressive
rivalry at a narrow outlet of the market-place.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;White Swan&rdquo; was the inn at which the up
&ldquo;Regent&rdquo; coach dined.&nbsp; It was kept at that time
by a man named Crouch, &ldquo;that long, sour old beggar,&rdquo;
in the words of Tom Hennesy.&nbsp; Here &ldquo;the process of
dining on a really cold day in winter,&rdquo; to quote Colonel
Birch Reynardson, &ldquo;was carried on under no small amount of
difficulty.&nbsp; Your hands were frozen, your feet were frozen,
your very mouth felt frozen, and in fact you felt frozen all
over.&nbsp; Sometimes, with all this cold, you were also wet
through, your hat wet through, your coat wet through, the large
wrapper that was meant to keep your neck warm and dry wet
through, and, in fact, you were wet through yourself to your very
bones.&nbsp; Only twenty minutes were allowed for dinner; and by
the time you had got your hands warm enough to be able to untie
your neck wrapper, and had got out of your great-coat, which,
being wet, clung tenaciously to you, the time for feeding was
half gone.&nbsp; By the time you had got one quarter of what you
could have consumed, had your mouth been in eating trim and <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>your hands
warm enough to handle your knife and fork, the coachman would put
his head in, and say: &ldquo;Now, gentlemen, if you please; the
coach is ready.&rdquo;&nbsp; After this summons, having struggled
into your wet greatcoat, bound your miserable wet wrapper round
your miserable cold throat, having paid your two and sixpence for
the dinner that you had the will, but not the time, to eat, with
sixpence for the waiter, you wished the worthy Mr. Crouch good
day, grudged him the half-crown he had pocketed for having dined
so miserably, and again mounted your seat, to be rained and
snowed upon, and almost frozen to death before you reached
London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leaving Biggleswade, the Ivel is crossed and Tingey&rsquo;s
Corner passed.&nbsp; Tingey&rsquo;s Corner marks the junction of
the old alternative route from Welwyn, by Hitchin to Lower
Codicote, the route adopted by record-breaking cyclists.&nbsp;
The hamlets of Lower Codicote and Beeston Green open up a view of
Sandy, <a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>away to the right, with its range of yellow sand-hills
running for some three miles parallel with the road, and seeming
the more impressive by reason of the dead level on which they
look.&nbsp; The canal-like, bare banks of the Ivel are passed
again at Girtford, and the roadside cottages of Tempsford
reached; the village and church lying off to the left, where the
Ouse and the Ivel come to their sluggish confluence, and form a
waterway which once afforded marauding Danes an excellent route
from the coast up to Bedford.&nbsp; Even now the remains of a
fortification they constructed to command this strategic point
are visible, and bear the name of the &ldquo;Dannicke&rdquo;;
that is to say, the &ldquo;Danes&rsquo; work,&rdquo; or perhaps
the &ldquo;Danes&rsquo; wick,&rdquo; &ldquo;wick&rdquo; meaning
&ldquo;village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An infinitely later work&mdash;Tempsford turnpike-gate, to
wit&mdash;has disappeared a great deal more effectively than
those ancient entrenchments, and the way is clear and flat, not
to say featureless, over the Ouse, past the outlying houses of
Wyboston, and so into Little End, the most southerly limit of
Eaton Socon.</p>
<h2>XVIII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Past</span> Tempsford some of the coaches,
notably the Stamford &ldquo;Regent,&rdquo; turned off into the
loop road by St. Neots and Huntingdon.&nbsp; In the winter time,
or when the spring rains were falling, they did this at some
risk, for the low-lying land by the river Ouse was often
awash.&nbsp; Two old ladies were on one occasion given a terrible
fright, the road being deeply flooded and the water coming into
the coach, so that they had to stand on the seats.&nbsp; They
quite thought they were going to be drowned, and perhaps they
would have been had the &ldquo;Regent&rdquo; been driven by one
unused to the road.&nbsp; Had the coachman driven into a
ditch&mdash;as he might easily have done with the floods covering
all the landmarks&mdash;it would have been &ldquo;all up&rdquo;
with <a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>the
&ldquo;insides&rdquo; for certain and perhaps for the
&ldquo;outsides&rdquo; as well.</p>
<p>The most prudent coachmen in winter time kept to the main
road, which lies somewhat higher, and passed through Eaton
Socon.&nbsp; Once&mdash;to judge by its name&mdash;a place of
importance, this is now only a long village of one straggling
street.&nbsp; At some undetermined period the head of a
&ldquo;soke,&rdquo; or separate legal jurisdiction, all memories
of the dignity implied are gone, save only the empty title, which
Dickens makes fun of by calling the village in <i>Nicholas
Nickleby</i> &ldquo;Eton Slocomb.&rdquo;&nbsp; The &ldquo;White
Horse,&rdquo; a picturesque roadside inn, may be looked upon with
interest by those keen on identifying Dickens landmarks.&nbsp; In
later days it became a favourite resort of the North Road Cycling
Club, and witnessed the beginning and ending of many a road race
in the &ldquo;eighties&rdquo; and early &ldquo;nineties,&rdquo;
when such things were.</p>
<p>The story of the London to York cycling record is fitly to be
told in this page.&nbsp; It is not so long a tale as that of the
famous one from London to Brighton and back, but it stands for
greater efforts and for a vast amount of pluck and
endurance.&nbsp; There have been those unsportsmanlike souls who,
not finding sport an end in itself, have questioned the use of
record making and breaking.&nbsp; But it has had its use, and
even from this point of view has amply justified itself, for the
continually increasing speed required out of cycles for these
purposes has led to the perfecting of them within what is, after
all, a comparatively short time; so that the sporting clubman
has, after all, while strictly occupied within the range of his
own ambitions, contributed to the general good by bringing about
the manufacture of a vehicle which, used by many hundreds of
thousands of people who never raced in their lives, and are
probably incapable of a speed of more than twelve miles an hour,
has brought the roads and lanes of the country within the
knowledge of many to whom rural life was something new and
strange.</p>
<p>The first recorded cycle ride to York in which <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>speed was
an object was that of C. Wheaton, September 1872.&nbsp; That
pioneer took two days to perform the journey, making Stamford, a
distance of eighty-nine miles, the end of his first day&rsquo;s
adventure, in 15&frac12; hours, and on the second day reaching
York in a further 26 hours 40 minutes: total, 42 hours 10
minutes.&nbsp; This, with the front-driving low cycle of those
days, was an achievement.&nbsp; Wooden wheels and iron tyres did
not conduce to either speed or ease, and that now historic
figure, painfully crawling (as we should now think his progress)
to York is heroic.</p>
<p>Perhaps this tale of hardship was calculated to deter others
from trying their mettle, but at any rate it was not until July
9, 1874, that two others, Ian Keith-Falconer and J. H. Stanley
Thorpe, followed, and they failed in the effort.&nbsp; After
another two years had almost passed, on June 5, 1876, Thorpe made
another attempt.&nbsp; Leaving Highgate Archway at 11.10 <span
class="GutSmall">P.M.</span>, he arrived the next day at York at
9.40 <span class="GutSmall">P.M.</span> = 22 hours 30 minutes;
chiefly, of course, by favour of that then &ldquo;improved&rdquo;
form of bicycle, the tall &ldquo;ordinary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thirteen years passed before this record was lowered, and the
one that replaced it was not a remarkable performance,
considering the further great improvements in cycles.&nbsp; This
ride, in the summer of 1889, performed on a solid-tyred
&ldquo;safety,&rdquo; took 21 hours 10 minutes, and was beaten in
the same year by six minutes by H. R. Pope, riding a tricycle;
himself displaced, shortly after, by F. T. Bidlake, also mounted
on a tricycle, who did the 197 miles in 18 hours 28 minutes.</p>
<p>In 1890, and for several years following, records came and
went with increasing rapidity.&nbsp; In 1890 J. M. James put the
safety record at 16 hours 52 minutes, and T. A. Edge soon
followed, reducing it to 14 hours 33 minutes, James regaining the
record again in 1891 by a bare thirteen minutes.&nbsp; In the
following year, S. F. Edge, on a front-driving safety, made a
splendid record of 12 hours 49 minutes, but <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>had the
mortification to see it beaten the next day, June 27, by F. W.
Shorland, in 39 minutes less.&nbsp; In this year there were
several rival tricycle records: that of W. J. A. Butterfield, of
18 hours 9 minutes being lowered by F. T. Bidlake by nearly three
hours, and beaten again, on September 29, Bidlake&rsquo;s figures
on this occasion being 13 hours 19 minutes.&nbsp; On the same day
M. A. Holbein and F. W. Shorland rode to York on a tandem
tricycle in exactly the same time.</p>
<p>C. C. Fontaine went for the safety record on August 29, 1894,
when he put the figures down to 11 hours 51 minutes.&nbsp;
Fontaine lowered his own record in the following year, on October
18, by 21 minutes 45 seconds, and this was disposed of by George
Hunt on May 7, 1896, when he got well within the eleven hours, at
10 hours 48 minutes.</p>
<p>This was lowered by F. R. Goodwin on July 19, 1899, his time
being 10 hours 16 minutes; the speed on this occasion averaging
rather over nineteen miles an hour.&nbsp; Even this could not
have been accomplished without the aid of the most perfect motor
pace-making arrangements.&nbsp; Goodwin smashed all these
previous records on his way to establish the London to Edinburgh
record of 25 hours 26 minutes, in which the average was somewhat
higher; nearly twenty miles an hour.</p>
<p>The next, and latest, safety cycle record to York was made,
unpaced, in 1900; when H. Green performed the journey in 10 hours
19 minutes.</p>
<p>The tandem safety London to York records should be
mentioned.&nbsp; The first two were set up on July 24, 1895, and
October 2, 1896, respectively: by G. P. Mills and T. A. Edge; and
T. Hobson and H. E. Wilson, the times being 12 hours 33 minutes,
and 11 hours 35 minutes.</p>

<h2>XIX</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Eaton</span> Socon, its long straggling
street and beautiful church-tower, left behind, the road descends
to the &ldquo;river Kym,&rdquo; as the guidebooks call the tiny
stream which, bordered by marshes, crosses under the road at a
point known as Cross Hall.&nbsp; The &ldquo;river Kym&rdquo;
certainly is, or was, important enough to confer its name upon
the neighbouring townlet of Kimbolton, but the country folk now
only know it as Weston Brook.&nbsp; The descent to it has of late
years acquired the name of &ldquo;Chicken Hill,&rdquo; given by
the North Roaders, racing cyclists, who must often have run over
the fowls kept by the people of a cottage at the bottom.&nbsp;
This is succeeded by Diddington Bridge, a picturesque,
white-painted timber structure spanning the little Diddington
Brook, which has eaten its way deeply into the earth, and is
romantically shaded by tall trees and bordered by the undergrowth
that fills the pretty hollow.</p>
<p><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>The
slight rise from this spot is succeeded by an easy descent into
narrow-streeted Buckden, one of those old
&ldquo;thoroughfare&rdquo; coaching villages which imagined
themselves on the way to becoming towns in the fine, free-handed
old days.&nbsp; The huge bulk of the &ldquo;George&rdquo; is
eloquent of this, with its fifteen windows in a row, and the
signs still noticeable in the brickwork, showing where the house
was doubled in size at the period of its greatest
prosperity.&nbsp; Nowadays the &ldquo;George&rdquo; is all too
large for its trade, and a portion of it is converted into
shops.&nbsp; As for the interminable rooms and passages above,
they echo hollow to the infrequent footfall, where they were once
informed with a cheerful bustle and continuous arrival and
departure.&nbsp; There was a period, a few years ago, when the
North Road Club&rsquo;s road-racing events brought crowds of
cyclists and busy times once more to the &ldquo;George,&rdquo;
but they are irretrievably gone.</p>
<p>To and from Buckden and Welwyn in coaching times drove every
day the notable Cartwright, of the York &ldquo;Express&rdquo;; a
day&rsquo;s work of about seventy miles.&nbsp; Cartwright was
something more than a coachman, being himself landlord of the
&ldquo;George&rdquo; at Buckden, and horsing one or two of the
stages over which he drove.&nbsp; &ldquo;Peter Pry,&rdquo; one of
the old <i>Sporting Magazine&rsquo;s</i> coaching critics, waxes
eloquent over him.&nbsp; It was a vile day when, to sample
Cartwright&rsquo;s quality, he set out by the York
&ldquo;Express&rdquo; from London for Grantham; but neither the
weather nor the scenery, nor anything in Heaven or Earth drew his
attention from Cartwright.&nbsp; He starts at once with being
struck at Welwyn with Cartwright&rsquo;s graceful and easy way of
mounting the box, and then proceeds to make a kind of admiring
inventory of his person.&nbsp; Thus, he might have been
considered to be under fifty years of age, bony, without fat;
healthy looking, evidently the effect of abstemiousness; not too
tall, but just the size to sit gracefully and powerfully.&nbsp;
His right hand and whip were beautifully in unison; he kept his
horses like clock-work, and to see the refinement <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>with which
he managed the whip was well worth riding many hours on a wet
day.&nbsp; But the occasions on which he used the whip were rare,
although the tits were only fair, and not by any means
first-rate.&nbsp; No dandy, but equipped most respectably and
modestly, and with good taste, he was the idol of the road, both
with old and young; while his manners on the box were respectful,
communicative without impertinence, and untarnished with
slang.&nbsp; Acquainted with everybody and every occupation
within his sphere, he was an entertaining companion even to an
ordinary traveller; but he enchanted the amateur of coaching with
his perfect professional knowledge, which embraced all
niceties.&nbsp; His excellent qualities, we are glad to notice,
in conclusion, had gained their reward; he was well-to-do, lived
regularly, had a happy family, and envied neither lord nor
peasant.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Welwyn, the road to Buckden, and Buckden itself seem quite
lonely without this figure of all the virtues and the graces.</p>
<p>Spelt &ldquo;Bugden&rdquo; in other times, the inhabitants
still pronounce its name in this way.&nbsp; There is a
well-defined air of aristocracy about this village, due partly to
the ruined towers of the old palace of the Bishops of Lincoln,
and to the sturdy old red-brick walls that enclose the grounds in
which they stand.&nbsp; They are walls with a thickness and
lavish use of material calculated to make the builder of
&ldquo;desirable villa residences&rdquo; gasp with dismay at such
apparently wanton extravagance.&nbsp; But the Bishops of Lincoln,
who built those walls in the fifteenth century, had not obtained
their land on a building lease; and, moreover, they were building
for their own use, which makes a deal of difference, it must be
conceded.</p>
<p>You cannot help noticing these walls, for they run for some
distance beside the road.&nbsp; Through a gateway is seen a
pleasant view of lawns and the front of a modern mansion.&nbsp;
The Bishops have long left Buckden, and have gone to reside at
their palace at Lincoln, Buckden Palace having been wantonly
demolished <a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>when the Order in Council, authorising these Right
Reverend Fathers in God to alienate the property, was
obtained.&nbsp; The church adjoins their roofless old gatehouse,
and is a fine old place of worship, with a stone spire of the
Northants type.</p>
<p>In this church will be found a singular example of
modesty.&nbsp; It is an epitaph without the name of the
person:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Sacred to the
memory of<br />
AN OFFICER,<br />
who sincerely regarded this<br />
his native village<br />
and caused an asylum to be erected, to protect<br />
Age, and to reward Industry.<br />
Reader, ask not his name.<br />
If thou approve a deed which succours<br />
the helpless, go and emulate it.<br />
Obiit 1834, aet 65.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tiny hamlet of Hardwick, dignified with mention on the
Ordnance map, is passed without its existence being noticed, and
the road, flat as though constructed with the aid of a
spirit-level, proceeds straight ahead for the town of Huntingdon,
swinging acutely to the left for York.&nbsp; Beyond, at the
cross-roads, stands Brampton Hut, the modern vivid red-brick
successor of the old inn of that name.&nbsp; Brampton village
lies down the cross-road to the right, and is the place where
Samuel Pepys, it is thought, was born in 1632. <a
name="citation117"></a><a href="#footnote117"
class="citation">[117]</a>&nbsp; The registers afford no
information, for they do not begin until twenty-one years later,
and the old gossip himself makes no mention of the fact.&nbsp;
His father and mother lived here, and both lie in the
church.&nbsp; Their home, his birthplace, stands even now, but so
altered that it is practically without much interest.&nbsp; It
was in its garden, in October, 1666, that Samuel caused his
&pound;1,300 to be buried when the Dutch descent upon London was
feared.&nbsp; A timorous soul, poor Samuel! sending his father
and his wife down from London to Brampton with the gold, and with
&pound;300 in a girdle round where his waist should have been,
but was not, for Samuel <a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>was a man of &ldquo;full
habit,&rdquo; as the elegant phrase, seeking to disguise the
accusation of exceeding fatness, has it.&nbsp; Great was his
anxiety when, the national danger over, he came down to disinter
his hoard.&nbsp; &ldquo;My father and I with a dark lantern, it
being now night, into the garden with my wife, and there went
about our great work to dig up my gold.&nbsp; But Lord! what a
tosse I was for some time in, that they could not justly tell
where it was; but by and by, poking with a spit, we found it, and
then begun with a spudd to lift up the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But they had not been cautious in their work.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;to see how sillily they
hid it, not half a foot under ground, in sight of passers-by and
from the neighbours&rsquo; windows.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he found
the gold all loose, and the notes decaying with the damp, and all
the while, routing about among the dirt for the scattered pieces,
he was afraid lest the neighbours should see him, and fancy the
Pepys family had discovered a gold mine; so he took up dirt and
all, and, carrying it to his brother&rsquo;s bedroom, washed it
out with the aid of several pails of water and some besoms, with
the result that he was still over a hundred pieces short.&nbsp;
This &ldquo;made him mad.&rdquo;&nbsp; He could not go out in the
garden with his father, because the old man was deaf, and, in
shouting to him, all the neighbours would get to know.&nbsp; So
he went out with W. Hewer, and by diligent grubbing in the mould,
made the sum nearly tally.&nbsp; The day after, leaving his
father to search for the remainder, we find him setting out for
London, with his belongings; the gold in a basket in the coach,
and he coming to look after it every quarter of an hour.</p>
<p>Something over a mile distant from Brampton cross-roads, and
passing over two little bridges, we come to a third bridge,
spanning one of the lazy rivulets that trickle aimlessly through
the flats.&nbsp; It is just an old red-brick bridge, braced with
iron and edged with timber; an innocent-looking, although dull
and lonely spot, with the water trickling along in <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>its deeply
worn bed, and no sound save the occasional splash made by a
frightened water-rat.&nbsp; Yet this is &ldquo;Matcham&rsquo;s
Bridge,&rdquo; and the scene of an infamous murder.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Matcham&rsquo;s Bridge, spanning the little river Wey,
obtained its name from the murder of a drummer-boy here by
Gervase (or Jarvis) Matcham, on the 19th of August 1780.&nbsp;
The murder was a remarkable one, and is made additionally
memorable by the after-career of the murderer, whose bloody deed
and subsequent confession, six years later, form the subject of
the <i>Dead Drummer</i>, one of Barham&rsquo;s <i>Ingoldsby
Legends</i>.</p>
<p>Gervase Matcham, the son of a farmer living at Frodingham, in
Yorkshire, had a varied and adventurous career.&nbsp; When in his
twelfth year, he ran away from home and became a jockey.&nbsp; In
the course of this employment he was sent to Russia in charge of
some horses presented by the Duke of Northumberland to the
Empress, and returning to London well supplied with money,
dissipated it all in evil courses.&nbsp; He then shipped as a
sailor on board the <i>Medway</i> man-of-war, but after a short
experience of fighting, managed to desert.&nbsp; He had no sooner
landed in England than he was seized by one of the prowling
pressgangs that then scoured the seaports, and was shipped aboard
the <i>Ariadne</i>, fitting out on an expedition to destroy the
pirate, Paul Jones.&nbsp; Succeeding in an attempt to escape when
off Yarmouth, he enlisted in the 13th Regiment of Foot, and
deserting again, near Chatham, set out to tramp through London to
York, visiting Huntingdon on the way.&nbsp; The 49th Regiment was
then recruiting in the district, and Matcham promptly enlisted in
it.</p>
<p>From Huntingdon, on the 19th of August 1780, he was sent to
Major Reynolds at Diddington, to draw some subsistence-money,
amounting to between &pound;6 and &pound;7.&nbsp; With him was a
drummer-boy, Benjamin Jones, aged about sixteen years, the son of
the recruiting sergeant.&nbsp; The boy having drawn the money,
they <a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>returned along the high road, Matcham drinking on the
way.&nbsp; Instead of turning off to Huntingdon, Matcham induced
the boy to go on with him in the direction of Alconbury, and
picking a quarrel with him at the bridge, seized him and cut his
throat, making off with the money.&nbsp; He then fled across
country to the nearest seaport, and shipped again to sea.&nbsp;
For six years he continued in the Navy and saw hard fighting
under Rodney and Hood, being at last paid off H.M.S.
<i>Sampson</i> at Plymouth, on June 15, 1786.&nbsp; From Plymouth
he set out with a messmate&mdash;one John Shepherd&mdash;to walk
along the Exeter Road to London.&nbsp; Near the &ldquo;Woodyates
Inn&rdquo; they were overtaken one afternoon by a thunderstorm in
which Matcham startled his shipmate by his abject terror of some
unseen apparition.&nbsp; Eventually he confessed his crime to
Shepherd, and begged his companion to hand him over to the
nearest magistrate, so that Justice might be satisfied.&nbsp; He
was accordingly committed at Salisbury, and, inquiries as to the
truth of his confession having been made, he was brought to trial
at Huntingdon, found guilty, and executed on the 2nd of August
1786, his body being afterwards hanged in chains on Alconbury
Hill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> summit of this convenient
Golgotha is the place where the North Road and the Great North
Road adjust their differences, and proceed by one route to the
North.&nbsp; Not a very terrible hill, after all, despite the way
in which it figures in the letters and diaries of old travellers;
but nowadays a very lonely place, although it is the
meeting-point of two main roads and that of a branch one.&nbsp;
It was once different indeed, and the great
&ldquo;Wheatsheaf&rdquo; inn and posting-house, which stood a
hundred yards or so away from the junction, used commonly to send
out thirty pairs of post-horses <a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>a day.&nbsp; This establishment was
kept in its prime by John Warsop, who lived long enough to see
his business ruined by railways.&nbsp; Let no one imagine the
&ldquo;Wheatsheaf&rdquo; public-house, standing where the roads
meet, to be the representative of that old posting-house.&nbsp;
Face north, and you will see a private house of considerable size
standing on the east side of the road, behind a hedge and
lawn.&nbsp; Not a beautiful house; in fact, an ugly house of a
dingy whitey-buff brick, the colour of pastry taken out of the
oven before it is properly baked.&nbsp; Approaching nearer, it
will be observed that this building is now divided into two
private residences.&nbsp; This was once the
&ldquo;Wheatsheaf.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the bygone days it possessed a
semicircular approach from the road, and afforded all the year
round, and round the clock of every day and night, a busy scene;
with the postboys, whose next turn-out it was, sleeping with spur
on heel, ready to mount and away at a minute&rsquo;s notice,
north, south, east, or west.&nbsp; Those times and manners are as
absolutely vanished as though they never had existed, and even
although there are yet living those who remember the old
&ldquo;Wheatsheaf&rdquo; of their youthful days, perhaps not one
wayfarer in a hundred has any idea of that once busy era on
Alconbury Hill.&nbsp; How many of all those who pass this way
have ever noticed that pathetic relic of the
&ldquo;Wheatsheaf&rsquo;s&rdquo; bygone prosperity, the old post
from which its sign used to hang?&nbsp; It is still to be seen,
by those who know where to look for it, facing the road, a
venerable and decrepit relic, now thickly covered with ivy, and
somewhat screened from the casual glance by the shrubs and trees
growing close beside it.</p>
<p>Travellers coming south could have a choice of routes to
London from Alconbury Hill, as the elaborate old milestone still
standing at the parting of the ways indicates, showing sixty-four
miles by way of Huntingdon, Royston, and Ware, and four miles
longer by the way we have come.&nbsp; This monumental milestone,
now somewhat dilapidated, railed round, <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>and with
some forlorn-looking wall-flowers growing inside the enclosure,
is a striking object, situated at a peculiarly impressive spot,
where the left-hand route by Huntingdon is seen going off on the
level to a vanishing-point lost in the distant haze, rather than
by any dip or curve of the road to right or left; the right-hand
road diving down the hill to Alconbury Weston and Alconbury at
its foot.</p>

<p>The descent, going north, is known as Stangate Hill, and leads
past the lonely churchyard of Sawtry St. Andrews, whose church
has disappeared as utterly as Sawtry Abbey, which, less wealthy
than the great abbeys of Ramsey, Thorney, Crowland, or
Peterborough, stood beside the road, and was besieged by
medi&aelig;val tramps:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sawtry-by-the-Way, that old Abbaye,<br />
Gave more alms in one day than all they.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus ran the old rhyme.&nbsp; To-day, the only vestiges of
that vanished religious house are in the names of Monk&rsquo;s
Wood, to the right of the road, descending the hill, and of the
Abbey Farm.</p>
<p>The foot of Stangate Hill is no doubt the place called by
Thoresby and others &ldquo;Stangate Hole,&rdquo; where highwaymen
were confidently to be expected.&nbsp; De Foe, writing about 1720
of this road, says: &ldquo;Some Parts are still paved with stone,
which strengthens the conjecture that the Name Stangate was given
it from thence.&nbsp; It traverses great woods between the Two
Saltries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his spelling of &ldquo;Sawtry,&rdquo; in that last line,
although he does not follow the invariable form, he has hit upon
the original.&nbsp; For &ldquo;Sawtry&rdquo; was in the beginning
&ldquo;Salt Reeth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Salt marshes and creeks crept
inland even as far as this, past Ely and Ramsey.</p>
<p>Stilton lies some three miles ahead, and, two miles before
reaching it, the old &ldquo;Crown and Woolpack,&rdquo; a very
large red-brick posting-house, part of it still occupied as an
inn, the rest used as cottages, while the stables are given over
to spiders and lumber.</p>
<p><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>Passing this, the road presently begins to rise gently,
and then, level again, widens out to almost treble its usual
width, where a long street of mingled old houses and cottages, a
medley of stone, brick, and plaster, stands, strangely
silent.&nbsp; This is Stilton, dreaming of bygone busy
times.&nbsp; Had the railway touched here, things would have worn
a very different aspect at Stilton to-day.&nbsp; Let us,
therefore, thank the shades of that Marquis of Exeter, and of the
others who resisted the railway, and by causing it to describe a
wide loop instead of hugging the road, unwittingly contributed to
the preservation in a glass case, as it were, of this old
coaching centre.</p>
<p>Night and day the coaches kept Stilton awake, and if for a few
minutes there was no coach, the post-chaises at one end of the
social scale, and the fly-wagons at the other, kept the inns
busy.&nbsp; Stilton buzzed with activity then.&nbsp; From the far
North came the drovers, doing twenty miles a day, with their
sheep and cattle, their pigs and geese; animal creation marching,
martyrs in their sort, to Smithfield.&nbsp; At Stilton they shod
the cattle, like horses, and one blacksmith&rsquo;s business here
consisted of nothing else than this.</p>
<p>The glory of Stilton has departed, and the &ldquo;Bell&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;Angel&rdquo; face one another, dolefully wondering
in what channels the tide of business now flows.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Bell&rdquo; is more racy of the soil than the
&ldquo;Angel,&rdquo; just as it is also much older.&nbsp; We are
here in a stone district, and the &ldquo;Bell&rdquo; is a
building of that warm yellowish stone characteristic of these
parts.&nbsp; Built at the very beginning of the seventeenth
century, it was already of a respectable age when the brick
&ldquo;Angel&rdquo; opposite began to rise from its
foundations.&nbsp; The older house is the feature of Stilton, its
great sign, with the mazy quirks and curls of its wrought-iron
supports, projecting far out towards the road, and arresting the
eye on first entering the street.&nbsp; The sign itself is
painted on copper, for the sake of lightness, but has long been
supported by a crutch, in the shape <a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>of a post.&nbsp; With this
ornamental iron-work, incomparably the finest sign on the road,
it was in the old days the subject of many wagers made by
coachmen and guards with unwary strangers who did not, like those
artful ones, know its measurements.&nbsp; It measures in fact 6
ft. 2&frac34; inches in height.</p>
<p>The old &ldquo;Talbot&rdquo; inn still has its coach gallery,
or balcony, in front.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Angel,&rdquo; in the best days of posting, became
the principal house at Stilton, and the little public-house of
that name next door to the commanding brick building which is now
a private residence was only the tap of the hotel.&nbsp; But the
&ldquo;Bell,&rdquo; that has seen the beginning and the end of
the &ldquo;Angel,&rdquo; still survives, with memories of the
days when the delicacy which renders the name of Stilton
world-famous had its origin.&nbsp; Allusion is hereby
made&mdash;need one explain it?&mdash;to &ldquo;Stilton&rdquo;
cheese.&nbsp; They say those old stagers who knew it when its
local reputation first began to be dispersed throughout the
country&mdash;that Stilton cheese is not what it was.&nbsp; What
is?&nbsp; The &ldquo;English Parmesan,&rdquo; they called it
then, when their palates first became acquainted with it, but it
deserved better of them than that.&nbsp; It was a species of
itself, and not justly comparable with aught else.&nbsp; But
Stilton cheese is not, nor ever was, made at Stilton, or anywhere
near it.&nbsp; It originated with Mrs. Paulet of Wymondham, near
Melton Mowbray, who first supplied it to Cooper Thornhill, the
once celebrated landlord of the &ldquo;Bell,&rdquo; for the use
of the table provided for the coach passengers and other
travellers who dined there.&nbsp; Mrs. Paulet&rsquo;s cheeses
immediately struck connoisseurs as a revelation, and they came
into demand, not only on Thornhill&rsquo;s table, but were
eagerly purchased for themselves or friends by those who
travelled this way.&nbsp; Thornhill was too business-like a man
to give away the secret of the make, and he did very well for
himself, charging as he did half-a-crown a pound.&nbsp; Then the
almost equally famous Miss Worthington, of the
&ldquo;Angel,&rdquo; began to supply <a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>&ldquo;Stilton&rdquo; cheeses, so
that scarce any one came through the place but was asked to buy
one.&nbsp; Nor did travellers usually wait to be asked.&nbsp; If
it happened that they did not want any for themselves, they were
usually charged by friends with commissions to purchase as they
passed through.&nbsp; Smiling waiters and maidservants, Miss
Worthington herself, rosy, plump, benevolent-looking, asked
travellers if they would not like to take away with them a real
Stilton cheese.&nbsp; Miss Worthington, the kindly, whose
lavender-scented beds were famed along the whole length of the
Great North Road&mdash;there she stood, declaring that they were
real Stilton cheeses!&nbsp; Nor were travellers for a long while
any the wiser.&nbsp; Stilton folks kept the secret well.&nbsp;
But it gradually leaked out.&nbsp; A native of those parts, too,
was the traitor.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray, sir, would you like a nice
Stilton cheese to take away with you?&rdquo; asked the
unsuspecting landlady, as the coach on whose outside he was
seated drew up.</p>

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you say they are made at Stilton?&rdquo; he asked in
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>Then came the crushing rejoinder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, Miss
Worthington, you know perfectly well that no Stilton cheese was
ever made at Stilton; they&rsquo;re all made in Leicestershire,
and as you say your cheeses are made at Stilton, they cannot be
good, and I won&rsquo;t have one.&rdquo;&nbsp; The secret was
then, of course, exploded.</p>
<p>Which of these two inns could it have been to which Mrs.
Calderwood of Coltness refers in her diary when, travelling from
Scotland to London in the middle of the eighteenth century, she
mentions at Stilton a &ldquo;fine large inn,&rdquo; where the
linen was &ldquo;as perfit rags as ever I saw: plain linen with
fifty holes in each towell.&rdquo;&nbsp; It would be interesting
to know, but it is hopeless now to attempt to identify it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Up-hill</span> from Stilton,
three-quarters of a mile away, but well within sight, stands the
Norman Cross inn, where the Peterborough, Louth, Lincoln, and
Hull coaches turned off to the right.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a name="image129" href="images/p129.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>Norman Cross! how many have been those old-time cyclists who
have partaken of the hospitality of the inn here!&nbsp; Not
always, though, has it been a place of welcome memories.&nbsp;
For years, indeed, during the long struggles between England and
France, this was the site of one of the largest of the prisons in
which captured French soldiers were incarcerated.&nbsp; Over
three thousand were placed here, officers and privates, some
remaining captive for more than ten years.&nbsp; Happy those who,
through influence or by mere luck, were selected to be exchanged
for our soldiers, prisoners in France.</p>
<p>It was a weary time for those poor fellows.&nbsp; Many of them
died in the great insanitary sheds in which <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>they were
confined, and others lost their reason.&nbsp; Desperate men
sometimes succeeded in escaping to the coast, where friends were
awaiting them.&nbsp; Others, wandering over the lonely flats,
perished miserably in the dykes and drains into which they fell
when the mists shrouded the countryside.&nbsp; There were, again,
those who stabbed the sentries and made off.&nbsp; Such an one
was Charles Fran&ccedil;ois Marie Bonchew, an officer, who had
wounded, but had not killed, a sentry named Alexander
Halliday.&nbsp; Being captured, he was sentenced to death at
Huntingdon, and was brought back to Norman Cross to be executed,
September 1808.&nbsp; All the prisoners were turned out to
witness the execution, and the garrison was under arms.</p>
<p>But it was not all savagery and horror here among those
military captives, for they were often allowed out on parole,
within certain hours and well-defined bounds.&nbsp; It was
understood that no prisoner out on parole should leave the
highroad, nor was he to be at large after sunset.&nbsp; If he
disregarded these rules he was liable to be shot at sight by any
one who had a gun handy.&nbsp; He was an Ishmael against whom
every hand was turned, and, indeed, the Post Office offered a
reward of &pound;5 to any mail guard who, seeing a prisoner
breaking parole, should shoot him.&nbsp; After several
inoffensive farm-labourers, going home after dusk, had been
peppered with shot in mistake by guards anxious to secure this
reward, the village streets and roads adjacent became singularly
desolate when a coach was heard approaching.</p>
<p>There were exceptions to these strict rules, and officers of
high rank&mdash;and consequently assumed to have a nicer sense of
honour than that obtaining among subalterns and the rank and
file&mdash;were permitted to take private lodgings at
Stilton.&nbsp; Those were the fortunate ones.&nbsp; Most of the
prisoners, unhappily, were penniless, and after a time even their
own Government refused supplies for their maintenance.&nbsp;
Accordingly, they obtained some few little luxuries, and employed
the time that hung so heavily on their <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>hands, by
carving toys and artistic nick-nacks out of fragments of wood, or
from the bones left from their rations, and selling them to the
crowds of country folks who came to gaze at them on certain
days.&nbsp; Straw-plaiting, too, was a prisoners&rsquo; industry,
until it was stopped by some of the military in charge.</p>
<p>In March, 1812, Sergeant Ives, of the West Essex Militia, was
stopped on the highway between Stilton and Norman Cross by a
number of persons unknown, who, after having knocked him down and
robbed him of his money and watch, wrenched open his jaws, and
with savage cruelty, cut off a piece of his tongue.&nbsp; It was
supposed that this outrage was in revenge for his having been
concerned in suppressing the plait trade at Norman Cross
barracks.</p>
<p>The prisoners were not entirely without spiritual consolation,
for the good Bishop de Moulines appointed himself their chaplain,
and, of his own free will leaving France, took up residence at
Stilton.&nbsp; He attended them in sickness, and helped them out
of his own resources.</p>
<p>The officers in charge of these prisoners were often brutal,
but that there were some who sympathised with their sorrows is
evident from the tablet still to be seen in Yaxley Church, a mile
distant, which tells of the gratitude of the prisoners for the
kindness shown them by Captain John Draper, R.N., who died after
being in charge of the prison for only eighteen months.</p>
<p>Norman Cross Prison, or &ldquo;Yaxley
Barracks&rdquo;&mdash;Norman Cross being in the parish of
Yaxley&mdash;built in 1796; was demolished in 1816, and no
vestige of it is left.</p>
<p>And so all recollection of these things might in time have
faded away had it not been for the monument erected by the
wayside in the fateful year 1914.&nbsp; Let us pause to consider
that moment.&nbsp; Events were hurrying towards the beginning of
the Great War of 1914&ndash;18, and the nation in general was
wholly ignorant of what was coming.&nbsp; Stupidly ignorant, for
there were <a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>many omens.&nbsp; It was at this moment, afterwards
seen to be so full of tragedy, that the memorial pillar on, or
near, the site of Yaxley Barracks, to the memory of those French
prisoners of war, was unveiled, July 28th, 1914, by Lord
Weardale.&nbsp; A gilded bronze French Imperial eagle stoops on
the crest of a handsome pillar, and on the plinth is a tablet
stating that this is a memorial to 1770 French prisoners who died
in captivity.</p>

<p>These incidents, &ldquo;picked from the wormholes of long
vanished days,&rdquo; give romance to the otherwise featureless
road onwards to Kate&rsquo;s Cabin and Water Newton.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Kate&rsquo;s Cabin&rdquo; inn is mentioned by every
road-book of coaching-times, but no one ever <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>condescended to explain the origin of this curious
sign, and the inn itself, once standing in the receipt of custom
at the cross-roads, three miles and a half from Norman Cross, is
now a pretty cottage.</p>

</a>Nearly two miles onward, Water Newton comes in sight,
standing, dry and secure, on its knoll above the water-meadows on
the river Nene.&nbsp; On the western face of its church tower,
which originally, before Wansford bridge was built and the road
diverted, faced the highway, may yet be seen a tabernacle
containing an ancient effigy of a man in semi-ecclesiastical
attire, his hands clasped in prayer.&nbsp; An inscription in
Norman French may with some difficulty be deciphered beneath it,
inviting the passer-by to pray for the soul of Thomas
Purden:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;VOVS KE PAR<br />
ISSI PASSEZ<br />
POVR LE ALME<br />
TOMAS PVR<br />
DEN PRIEZ.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Read aloud, we perceive this to be intended for rhyme.</p>
<p>No one prays for the soul of Thomas Purden nowadays, for these
two very excellent and individually sufficient reasons&mdash;that
prayers for the dead are not customary in the Church of England,
and that, since the road has been diverted, there are no
passers-by.</p>
<p>This brings us to the reason why Thomas Purden should have
expected wayfarers to intercede for his soul.&nbsp; That he
expected them to do this out of gratitude seems obvious; but it
is not at first evident for what <a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>they should be so grateful.&nbsp; We
are, however, to bear in mind that a road passed down beside this
church tower in those days, where no road&mdash;only a
meadow&mdash;exists to-day.&nbsp; The meadow slopes steeply to
the river, and doubtless a ford, a ferry, or some primitive
bridge was established here by Thomas Purden long before even a
wooden bridge existed at Wansford.&nbsp; In providing some safe
method by which travellers might pass this river, even now
subject to dangerous floods, Purden would have been a benefactor
in the eyes alike of men and of Holy Church, and fully entitled
to the prayers and intercessions of all.</p>

<p>For many years the head of the figure had disappeared, but
when the church was restored, some years since, an ingenious
mason fitted him with another which had, in the usual careless
fashion of <a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>restorers, been knocked off something else.&nbsp; And
it is a simple truth that since its &ldquo;restoration,&rdquo;
Water Newton church is sadly bare.</p>
<p>By the wayside, on the left, against the wall of a farm-house
residence, will be noticed an old milestone and horseman&rsquo;s
upping-block combined.&nbsp; It marks the 81st mile from London,
and bears the initials &ldquo;E. B.,&rdquo; together with the
date, 1708.&nbsp; This is perhaps the only survivor of a series
which, according to De Foe, in his &ldquo;Tour through the Whole
Island of Great Britain,&rdquo; a Mr. Boulter was projecting
&ldquo;to London, for the general benefit.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=
"Edmund Boulter&rsquo;s Milestone"

</a></p>
<p>Edmund Boulter was one of the family who were then seated at
Gawthorp Hall, near Leeds, and who, not much later, sold that
property to Henry Lascelles, father of the first Lord
Harewood.</p>
<p><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>At
the hamlet of Sibson, on the left hand in descending toward the
level-crossing at Wansford station, may still be seen the stocks
and whipping-post beside the road.&nbsp; To the right flows the
winding Nene, through illimitable oozy meadows, its course marked
in the far distance by the pollard willows that line its
banks.&nbsp; The Nene here divides the counties of
Huntingdonshire and Northants, Wansford itself lying in the
last-mentioned county and Stibbington on the hither side of the
river.&nbsp; The famous Wansford Bridge joins the two, and helps
to render Wansford and Stibbington one place in the eyes of
strangers.&nbsp; Both places belong to the Duke of Bedford,
Stibbington bearing the mark of its ownership distinctly visible
in its severe and uncomfortable-looking &ldquo;model&rdquo;
modern-gothic stone houses, with the coroneted &ldquo;B&rdquo; on
their gables.&nbsp; In this manner the accursed Russells have
bedevilled many of the villages and townlets unhappily owned by
them, and the feelings of all who live in their earmarked houses
must be akin to those of paupers who inhabit workhouses and
infirmaries, with the important exception that the Duke&rsquo;s
tenants pay rent and taxes.&nbsp; Wansford, fortunately, has not
been rebuilt, and it is possible for the villagers to live
without an uncomfortable sense of belonging, body and soul, to
the Dukes of Bedford.</p>
<p>The famous &ldquo;Haycock&rdquo; inn, usually spoken of as at
Wansford, is, in fact, on the Huntingdonshire side of the bridge,
and in Stibbington.&nbsp; Its sign alludes to the supposed origin
of the curious nick-name of &ldquo;Wansford-in-England,&rdquo;
first mentioned in that scarce little early eighteenth-century
book, <i>Drunken Barnaby&rsquo;s Four Journeys to the North of
England</i>.&nbsp; In its pages he describes being carried off by
a flood:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On a haycock sleeping soundly,<br />
Th&rsquo; River rose and took me roundly<br />
Down the current: People cry&rsquo;d;<br />
Sleeping, down the Stream I hy&rsquo;d:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Where away,&rsquo; quoth they, &lsquo;from
Greenland?&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;No, from Wansforth-brigs in
England.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>This
&ldquo;in England&rdquo; has puzzled many.&nbsp; It really refers
to the situation of Wansford in Northamptonshire, near, but not
in, &ldquo;Holland&rdquo;&mdash;the Holland division of
Lincolnshire.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Wansford&rsquo;s peculiar fame is thus more than local.&nbsp;
Perhaps the queer picture-sign of the grand old inn, representing
Drunken Barnaby on his haycock, helped to disperse it over
England in days when it could not fail to be seen by every
passing traveller.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Haycock&rdquo; ceased to be
an inn, and is now occupied as a hunting-box.&nbsp; It affords a
pleasing relief from the Duke of Bedford&rsquo;s
almshouse-looking cottages, and is a building not only of
considerable age, but of dignified architectural character.&nbsp;
Stone-built, with handsome windows and steep slated roof, and
carefully designed, even to its chimneys, it is, architecturally
speaking, among the very finest of the houses ever used as inns
in England, and has more the appearance of having been originally
designed as a private mansion than as a house of public
entertainment.&nbsp; The sign is now hung in the hall of the
house, the corbels it rested on being still visible beside the
present door, replacing the old archway by which the coaches and
post-chaises entered and left the courtyard of the inn of
old.</p>
<p><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>The
&ldquo;Haycock,&rdquo; even in its days as an inn, was a noted
hunting centre.&nbsp; Situated in the country of the Fitzwilliam
Hunt, it afforded, with its splendid accommodation for guests and
for horses, headquarters for those who had not a hunting-box of
their own, and in those days stabled as many as a hundred and
fifty horses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young Percival&rdquo; kept the &ldquo;Haycock&rdquo;
from about 1826, and drove the &ldquo;Regent&rdquo; between
Wansford and Stamford, in place of &ldquo;old John
Barker.&rdquo;&nbsp; At that time he had more valour than
discretion in driving, and on one occasion at least nearly
brought disaster upon the coach at the famous bridge by
&ldquo;punishing&rdquo; a spirited team which had given some
trouble at starting.&nbsp; At the steep and narrow entrance to
the bridge they took it in their heads to resent his
double-thonging, the leaders turning round, and the whole team
presently facing towards London instead of <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>Stamford.&nbsp; They had to be driven back to the
&ldquo;Haycock,&rdquo; and Barker took them on to Stamford.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a name="image139" href="images/p139.jpg">
<img alt=

 src="images/p139.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>That bridge would have been an exceedingly awkward place for a
coach accident.&nbsp; It is picturesqueness itself, and by
consequence not the most convenient for traffic.&nbsp; Originally
built in 1577, with thirteen arches, it was repaired in 1674, as
a Latin inscription carved midway on it informs the inquiring
stranger.&nbsp; In the winter of 1795 an ice-flood destroyed some
of the southernmost arches, which were replaced the following
year by two wider spans, so that Wansford Bridge has now only ten
openings.&nbsp; The northern approach to it from Stamford leads
down in a dangerous, steep, sudden, and narrow curve, intersected
by a cross-road.&nbsp; Now that there is no longer a turnpike
gate at this point to bring the traffic to a slow pace, this
descent is fruitful in accidents, and at least one cyclist has
been killed here in an attempt to negotiate this sharp curve on
the descent into the cross-road.&nbsp; An inoffensive cottage
standing at the corner opposite the &ldquo;Mermaid&rdquo; inn has
received many a cyclist through its window, and the new masonry
of its wall bears witness to the wreck caused by a heavy wagon
hurtling down the hill, carrying away the side of the house.</p>
<p>The five miles between Wansford and Stamford begin with this
long rise, whose crest was cut through in coaching days, the
earth taken being used to fill up a deep hollow which succeeded,
where a little brook trickled across the road, the coaches
fording it.&nbsp; Thence, by what used to be called in the old
road-books &ldquo;Whitewater Turnpike,&rdquo; past the few
cottages of Thornhaugh, and so to where the long wall of Burghley
Park begins on the right hand.&nbsp; Here the telegraph poles,
that have hitherto so unfailingly followed the highway, suddenly
go off to the right, and into Stamford by the circuitous Barnack
road, in deference to the objections, or otherwise, of the
Marquis of Exeter, against their going through his park.</p>
<p><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>The
famous Burghley House by Stamford town is not visible from the
road, and is indeed situated a mile within the park, only the
gate-house to the estate being passed in the long descent into
that outlying portion of the town known as Stamford Baron.</p>
<p>There is, amid the works of Tennyson, a curiously romantic
poem, &ldquo;The Lord of Burleigh,&rdquo; which on the part of
the literary pilgrim will repay close examination; and this
examination will yield some astonishing results.&nbsp; It is,
briefly stated, the story of an Earl masquerading as a landscape
painter and winning the heart and hand of a farmer&rsquo;s
daughter.&nbsp; He takes her, after the wedding, to
see&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A mansion more majestic<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than all those she saw before;<br />
Many a gallant gay domestic<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bows before him at the door.<br />
And they speak in gentle murmur<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When they answer to his call,<br />
While he treads with footstep firmer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Leading on from hall to hall.<br />
And, while now she wonders blindly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor the meaning can divine,<br />
Proudly turns he round and kindly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;All of this is mine and thine.&rsquo;<br />
Here he lives in state and bounty,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord of Burleigh, fair and free,<br />
Not a lord in all the county<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is so great a lord as he.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original person from whose doings this poem was written
was, in fact, Henry Cecil, tenth Earl, and afterwards first
Marquis, of Exeter.&nbsp; He was the lord of Burghley House (not
&ldquo;Burleigh Hall&rdquo;), by Stamford town, and his
descendants are there yet.</p>
<p>Not a landscape painter, but a kind of London man about town
and Member of Parliament for Stamford, 1774&ndash;1780,
1784&ndash;1790, and then plain Mr. Henry Cecil (for he did not
succeed his uncle in the title until December, 1793), he is found
rather mysteriously wandering about Shropshire in 1789, calling
himself (there is never any accounting for taste) &ldquo;Mr.
Jones.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was then a man who had been married
fourteen years, and was thirty-six years of age.</p>
<p>The scene opens (thus to put it in dramatic form) <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>on an
evening towards the end of June, 1789, when a stranger knocked at
the door of Farmer Hoggins at Great Bolas in Shropshire, and
begged shelter for the night.&nbsp; He was obviously a gentleman,
but called himself by the very plebian name of &ldquo;John
Jones.&rdquo;&nbsp; He made himself so agreeable that his stay
&ldquo;for the night&rdquo; lasted some weeks, and he returned
again in a month or so, taking up his residence in the
village.&nbsp; The attraction which brought him back to Great
Bolas was evidently Sarah Hoggins, the farmer&rsquo;s daughter,
at that time a girl of sixteen, having been born in June,
1773.&nbsp; He proposed for Sarah, and on April 17th, 1790, they
were married in Great Bolas Church, the register showing that he
married in the name of &ldquo;John Jones.&rdquo;&nbsp; Meanwhile
he had purchased land in the village, and built a house which he
called &ldquo;Bolas Villa.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gossip grew extremely
busy with this mysterious stranger who had thus descended upon
the place, and it was generally suspected that he was a
highwayman in an extensive way of business, especially as some
notable highway robberies happened coincidently with his
appearance.</p>
<p>Early in 1794, &ldquo;Mr. John Jones,&rdquo; living thus at
Great Bolas, learnt that his uncle, the ninth Earl of Exeter, had
died in December.&nbsp; Telling his wife they must journey into
Northamptonshire, where he had business, they set out and arrived
at &ldquo;Burghley House, by Stamford town,&rdquo; and there he
disclosed to her for the first time that he was not &ldquo;John
Jones,&rdquo; but Henry Cecil, and now Earl of Exeter.</p>
<p>At what time he broke the news to her that he was already a
married man there is no evidence to show.&nbsp; Strictly
speaking, he had made a bigamous marriage, because, although his
wife, one of the Vernons of Hanbury, in Worcestershire, had
eloped on June 14, 1789, with the Reverend William Sneyd, curate
of that place, he had at the time taken no steps to obtain a
divorce.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a name="image143" href="images/p143.jpg">
<img alt=
"Burghley House, by Stamford Town"
title=
"Burghley House, by Stamford Town"
 src="images/p143.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>But he had every excuse.&nbsp; He had honestly fallen in love
with Sarah Hoggins after thus meeting her while wandering about
the country a few days after <a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>his wife&rsquo;s flight; and he
obtained a divorce by Act of Parliament in March, 1791.&nbsp;
Having done this, he married Sarah Hoggins secondly some six
months later (October 3) in the City of London Church of St.
Mildred, Bread Street, in whose register his name appears as
&ldquo;Henry Cecil, bachelor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tennyson&rsquo;s poem is, therefore, rather more romantic than
truthful; and the lines which tell us how she murmured&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh!
that he<br />
Were again that landscape painter<br />
Who did win my heart from me,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>have no authority.&nbsp; Nor is there any evidence to warrant
the statement that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A trouble weighed upon her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And perplexed her, night and morn,<br />
With the burthen of an honour<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unto which she was not born.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The poet continues&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;So she droop&rsquo;d and droop&rsquo;d
before him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fading slowly from his side;<br />
Three fair children first she bore him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then before her time she died.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Countess of Exeter, in fact, died on January 18, 1797, not
quite twenty-four years of age; but not from &ldquo;the burthen
of an honour unto which she was not born.&rdquo;&nbsp; Happily,
accession to the ranks of the titled nobility is not fatal, as
the marriage of many distinguished ornaments of the musical
comedy stage assure us; and so we must charge the Poet Laureate
with the flunkey thought that blue blood is a kind apart, and not
to be admixed with other strains.&nbsp; This from the poet who
wrote&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Kind hearts are more than coronets,<br />
And simple faith than Norman blood.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is unexpected.</p>
<p>She left two sons and one daughter.&nbsp; Her eldest <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>son became
second Marquis of Exeter, his father, the Earl, having been
raised a step in the peerage in 1801.</p>
<p>The enterprising Earl married, thirdly, in 1800, the divorced
wife of the eighth Duke of Hamilton, and died May 1, 1804, aged
fifty; but his third wife survived until January 17, 1837.&nbsp;
In the billiard-room of Burghley House is a portrait-group of
&ldquo;the Lord of Burleigh&rdquo; and his wife, Sarah Hoggins,
by Sir Thomas Lawrence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bolas Villa&rdquo; was given by the Earl to his
godson.&nbsp; It has since been enlarged, and is now styled
&ldquo;Burghley Villa.&rdquo;&nbsp; The church of Great Bolas is
a grim-looking brick building of the eighteenth century, when
many of the Shropshire churches in that district were
rebuilt.</p>
<h2>XXII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Stamford</span> compels enthusiasm, from
the first glimpse of it on entering, to the last regretful
backward glance on leaving.&nbsp; It is historic, picturesque,
stately, aristocratic, and cleanly, all at once.&nbsp; Its
stone-built mansions and houses are chiefly of the Renaissance
period, from Elizabeth onwards to the time of George the First,
and it is in this sort the most beautiful town in England, after
Oxford and Cambridge, and even in some aspects surpassing
them.</p>
<p>Apart from its lovely churches, one seeks not Gothic
architecture at Stamford but the stateliness of classic methods
as understood in the sixteenth and seventeenth century
revival.&nbsp; It is this especial architectural character which
gives the town such an air of academic distinction and leads the
stranger to compare it with the great university towns, even
before the fact comes to his knowledge that Stamford itself was
once the seat of a University.</p>
<p>The entrance is of a peculiar stateliness, the broad quiet
street descending, lined with dignified private houses, to where
the river Welland flows beneath the <a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>bridge, dividing the counties of
Northampton and Lincoln, and Stamford Baron from Stamford
town.&nbsp; On the right hand rises the fine tower of St.
Martin&rsquo;s, its perforated battlements showing, lace-like,
against the sky, just as when Turner painted his view.&nbsp;
Lower down across the street straddles the sign of the great
&ldquo;George&rdquo; inn, and a few steps forward serve to
disclose the exquisite picture of St. Mary&rsquo;s tower and
spire soaring from the rising ground on the other side of the
river.&nbsp; The &ldquo;distracting bustle of the
&lsquo;George,&rsquo; which exceeded anything I ever saw or
heard,&rdquo; as the Reverend Thomas Twining wrote, in 1776, has
long since become a thing of the past, and a certain quiet
dignity now belongs to it, as to Stamford in general.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;George&rdquo; is an inn with a history.&nbsp;
Charles the First slept there, August 23, 1645, and a whole train
of dignitaries at one time or another.&nbsp; &ldquo;Billy the
Butcher,&rdquo; too, returning from Culloden, stayed in the
house, and with his officers celebrated that victory.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Billy the Butcher,&rdquo; one regrets to say, was the
vulgar nickname by which the people called William, Duke of
Cumberland.</p>
<p>Distinguished foreigners without number have rested here and
wondered at the habits of Englishmen.&nbsp; The foreigner, it is
to be feared, never, with every advantage, really understands us;
sometimes, too, he is so perverse that we find a difficulty in
understanding him.&nbsp; Thus, Master Estienne Perlin, who
travelled the roads and sampled the inns of England so far back
as 1558, says we were great drunkards then.&nbsp; He wrote an
account of his travels, and of England, as it appeared to him;
and the way in which he wrestles with the pronunciation of the
language is amusing enough.&nbsp; Thus, according to this
traveller, if an Englishman would treat you, he would say in his
language: &ldquo;Vis dring a&rsquo; quarta uin oim gasquim oim
hespaignol oim malvoysi.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is merely maddening,
and it is a positive relief to know that the meaning of it is,
&ldquo;Will you drink a quart of Gascony wine, another of
Spanish, and another of <a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>Malmsey?&rdquo;&nbsp; According to
this, the Englishman of three hundred years ago mixed his drinks
alarmingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;In drinking,&rdquo; continues this
amusing foreigner, &ldquo;they will say to you, a hundred times,
&lsquo;Drind iou,&rsquo; which is, &lsquo;I drink to you&rsquo;;
and you should answer them in their language,
&lsquo;Iplaigiou,&rsquo; which means &lsquo;I pledge
you.&rsquo;&nbsp; If you would thank them in their language, you
say, &lsquo;God tanque artelay.&rsquo;&nbsp; When they are
drunk,&rdquo; he concludes, &ldquo;they will swear by blood and
death that you shall drink all that is in your cup, and will say
to you thus: &lsquo;Bigod sol drind iou agoud
uin.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>Such customs as these must have been excellent business for
the &ldquo;George&rdquo; and its contemporaries.</p>
<p>To this inn belongs an incident not paralleled
elsewhere.&nbsp; The daughter of one of its landlords, Margaret,
daughter of Bryan Hodgson, married a bishop!&nbsp; Or, more
exactly, one who became a bishop: the Reverend Beilby Porteous,
who at the time of his marriage, in 1765, was vicar of Ruckinge
and Wittersham, in Kent.&nbsp; In 1776 he became Bishop of
Chester, and eleven years later Bishop of London.&nbsp; This was
long years before Whincup kept the house.&nbsp; He reigned here
in the full tide of the coaching age, and was one of the
proprietors of the &ldquo;Stamford Regent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much history has been made at Stamford, from the time when it
was the &ldquo;stone ford&rdquo; of the Romans across the
Welland, through the long ages of blood and destruction,
stretching, with little intermission, from the days of Saxon and
Danish conflicts to that final clash of arms in 1643, when
Cromwell held the town and besieged Burghley House; and to that
Monday in the first week of May, 1646, when Charles the First,
having slept the night before at the residence of Alderman Wolph
(descended from Wulph, son of King Harold) slipped through a
postern-gate in the town wall, and so escaped for a final few
hours as a free man.&nbsp; The gate is there yet, in the grounds
of Barn Hill House, a mansion which, in 1729, was purchased by
Stukeley, the antiquary, vicar of All Saints.</p>
<p><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>Here
is no place to tell of the Councils and Parliaments held at
Stamford; but, as justifying the academic air the town still
holds, it must be said that it was indeed the home of a
University, long centuries ago.&nbsp; It was following the early
quarrels of Oxford University and Oxford town that a body of
students left that seat of learning, in 1260, and set up a
temporary home at Northampton.&nbsp; Political troubles drove
them, six years later, to Stamford, where they founded several
Colleges and Halls, which were already flourishing when, in 1333,
the northern students at Oxford, disgusted with the alleged
favouritism shown to the southerners, left in a body and found a
welcome at Stamford.&nbsp; Liberty in those days was construed as
permission given the strong to oppress the weak, and so when
Oxford University and Oxford town jointly petitioned the king to
forbid the seceders learning where they listed, those unhappy
students were promptly arrested and sent back to suck wisdom from
<i>alma mater</i> on the Isis.&nbsp; Oxford and Cambridge both
agreed not to recognise degrees conferred by Stamford, and at
length, by 1463, this University was strangled.</p>
<p>The actual relics of those times are few.&nbsp; Chief in point
of interest is the old Brasenose Gate, the only fragment of the
College of that name, said to have been founded by students from
Brasenose College, Oxford.&nbsp; Here remained until recent years
the ancient bronze knocker, in the form of a lion&rsquo;s head
with a massive ring in its mouth, brought, according to the
legend, from the Oxford college.&nbsp; This knocker certainly
belongs to a period not later than the thirteenth century, and
may have been conveyed away.&nbsp; Whether it was the original
&ldquo;brazen nose,&rdquo; said to have originated the odd name
of the College, or whether that name arose from the
<i>brassen-huis</i>, or brew-house, whose site the original
College was built upon, is one of those mysteries of derivation
never likely to be solved.&nbsp; During the last years of its
stay at Stamford, the knocker was kept in a house adjoining,
until it and the house were purchased by <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>Brasenose
College, Oxford, in whose Common Room the ancient relic now
occupies a place of honour.</p>

<p>Stamford was attached to the Yorkist cause in the Wars of the
Roses, and had occasion to regret the fact; for it offered an
especial mark to the victorious Lancastrians in 1461, after the
battle of St. Albans, when Sir Andrew Trollope, with the triple
ferocity of the <i>trois loups</i> from which the name derives,
fell upon the town and pillaged and burnt it.&nbsp; Eight
churches, two castles, and the town walls, together with many <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>hundreds of
houses, were destroyed, and Stamford has never recovered its
ancient importance since then.&nbsp; It is enough for us that it
is among the stateliest of towns, stone-built and dignified; with
its beautiful churches of St. Mary, All Saints, and St. Martin;
its old almshouses and mansions, not exactly matched in all
England.</p>
<p>The histories tell of a long list of famous men, natives of
Stamford; but the mere mental capacity or personal bravery shown
by these great ones is sardonically overshadowed by the physical
greatness of quite another kind of person, who, although not even
a native of Stamford, has, by his dying here, shed an especial
lustre upon the town.</p>

</a>Far transcending the fame of all other personages is that of
Daniel Lambert, the Fat Man.&nbsp; In the computation of
avoirdupois and of the tape-measure, this was the greatest figure
that ever travelled the Great North Road.&nbsp; No king or noble
can vie with him, nor are saintly shrines more zealously visited
than his grave in the old churchyard of St. Martin&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
While the tomb of that great Cecil, the Lord Treasurer Burghley,
within the church, remains often unvisited, photographs of Daniel
Lambert and of his epitaph meet the traveller at every turn.</p>
<p><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>Although destined to this undying fame, and to pothouse
canonisation, Daniel&rsquo;s career was short, as that epitaph
tells us:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;In Remembrance
of<br />
That Prodigy in Nature<br />
DANIEL LAMBERT<br />
who was possessed of<br />
An exalted and convivial mind<br />
And in personal greatness<br />
Had no Competitor<br />
He measured three feet, one inch, round the leg<br />
Nine feet, four inches, round the body<br />
And Weighed<br />
Fifty-two stone Eleven pounds<br />
He departed this life<br />
On the 21st of June<br />
1809<br />
Aged 39 years.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His diet is said to have been plain, and the quantity
moderate, and he never drank anything stronger than water.&nbsp;
His countenance was manly and intelligent, and he had a melodious
tenor voice.&nbsp; For some years before his death he had toured
the country, exhibiting himself, and visited London on two
occasions.&nbsp; The weights and measurements quoted on his
tombstone were taken at Huntingdon only the day before his
death.&nbsp; In the evening he arrived at the &ldquo;Waggon and
Horses,&rdquo; Stamford, in good health, in preparation for
&ldquo;receiving company&rdquo; during Stamford Races, but before
nine o&rsquo;clock the next morning was dead in the room on the
ground floor which he had taken because of his inability to go
upstairs.&nbsp; For many years two of his suits were shown at the
inn, seven men often succeeding in squeezing themselves within
the mighty embrace of his waistcoat, without bursting a
button.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Waggon and Horses&rdquo; has long since
given place to a school, and so here is a place of pilgrimage the
less; but Daniel&rsquo;s fame is immortal, for he lives as the
sign of many an inn and refreshment-house, whose proprietors use
him as an advertisement of the plenteous fare to be obtained
within, regardless of the fact that his immense bulk was due
rather to a dropsical habit than to much eating or drinking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> road, mounting steeply out of
Stamford, reaches a fine, elevated track commanding wide
views.&nbsp; This is the spot chosen by Forrest for his painting
of the old &ldquo;Highflyer&rdquo; London, York, and Edinburgh
coach which ran from 1788 to 1840.&nbsp; In less than two miles
the road crosses the border of Lincolnshire, traversing for six
miles an outlying corner of little Rutland, the smallest county
in England, and entering Lincolnshire again on passing
Stretton.&nbsp; Great Casterton, at the foot of the hill two and
a quarter miles from Stamford, is in Rutland.&nbsp; It is said to
be situated on the Guash, but that stream and the bridge over it,
from which the old road-books often called the village
&ldquo;Bridge Casterton,&rdquo; are not readily glimpsed.</p>
<p>It is a pretty stone-built village, with a well preserved
Early English church beside the road.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Greatness,&rdquo; either as a village or as the site of a
Roman &ldquo;castrum&rdquo; (whence derives the
&ldquo;Caster&rdquo;-ton) has long ceased to be a characteristic
of this pleasant spot, and the ancient Roman camp is now visible
only in some grassy banks where the rathe primrose grows.</p>
<p>Just beyond Casterton, coyly hiding down a lane to the left,
is the little village of Tickencote, preserving in its name some
prehistoric goat-farm, &ldquo;Tyccen-cote&rdquo; meaning in the
Anglo-Saxon nothing more nor less than
&ldquo;goat&rsquo;s-home.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of more tangible interest
is the splendid Norman church, of small size but extraordinary
elaboration; a darkling building with heavy chancel arch covered
with those zigzags, lozenges, birds&rsquo; heads, and
tooth-mouldings so beloved by Norman architects, and with a
&ldquo;Norman&rdquo; nave built in 1792 to replace that portion
of the building destroyed many years before.&nbsp; The
pseudo-Norman work of our own day is, almost without exception,
vile, and that of the eighteenth century was worse, but here is
an <a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>example of such faithful copying of existing portions
that now, since a hundred years and more have passed and the
first freshness of the new masonry gone, it is difficult to
distinguish the really old work from the copy.</p>

<p>Returning to the highroad, a further two miles bring us to
Horn Lane, the site of a vanished turnpike gate, and to the
coppices and roadside trees of Bloody Oaks, where the battle of
Empingham was fought, March 13, 1470, between the forces of
Edward the Fourth and the hastily assembled Lincolnshire levies
of Sir Robert Welles and Sir Thomas de la Launde, fighting,
<i>not</i> for the Lancastrian cause, as so often stated, but in
an insurrection fomented by the Earl of Warwick, whose object was
to raise Edward&rsquo;s brother, the Duke of Clarence, to the
throne.&nbsp; It was a massacre, rather than a battle, for
Edward&rsquo;s army was both more numerous and better equipped,
and the rebels soon broke and fled.&nbsp; Flinging away their
weapons, and even portions of their clothing, as they went, the
fight <a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>was readily named &ldquo;Losecoat Field.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The captured leaders paid for their ineffectual treason with
their blood, for they were executed at Stamford.</p>

execution of John Bowland, a highwayman who was gibbeted at
Empingham Corner in 1769.</p>
<p>Greetham spire now rises away to the left, and shows where
that village lies hid.&nbsp; Here, away from the village and
facing the highroad, stood, and stands still, the &ldquo;Greetham
Inn.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is now a farmhouse, and has lost its
stables, its projecting bar-parlour, and its entrance
archway.&nbsp; Once, however, it was one of the foremost inns and
posting-houses on the road.&nbsp; Marked on old Ordnance maps as
the &ldquo;Oak,&rdquo; it seems to have been really named the
&ldquo;New Inn,&rdquo; if we may judge from an inscription cut on
stone under the eaves: &ldquo;This is the New Inn,
1786.&rdquo;&nbsp; However this may have been, it was known to
travellers, coachmen, and postboys along the road only as
&ldquo;Greetham Inn.&rdquo;&nbsp; Towards the last it was kept by
one of the Percivals of Wansford.&nbsp; At that time no fewer
than forty-four coaches&mdash;twenty-two up and the same number
down&mdash;changed here and at the &ldquo;Black Bull,&rdquo;
Witham Common, every twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>Less than a mile down the road is that humble little
public-house whose strange sign, the &ldquo;Ram Jam,&rdquo; has
puzzled many people.&nbsp; Its original name was the
&ldquo;Winchilsea Arms,&rdquo; and it bore no other sign than the
armorial shield of the Earls of Winchilsea until long after
coaching days were done; but in all that time it was known only
as the &ldquo;Ram Jam House,&rdquo; and thereby hangs a tale, or
several tales, most of them untrue.&nbsp; All kinds of wild
legends of the house being so crammed with travellers that it was
called &ldquo;Ram Jam,&rdquo; from that circumstance, have been
heard.&nbsp; But travellers, as a matter of fact, never stayed
there, for the inn never had any accommodation for them.&nbsp; It
was more a beer-house than anything else.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>fame began
about 1740, when the landlord was an officer&rsquo;s servant,
returned from India.&nbsp; He possessed the secret of compounding
a liqueur or spirit which he sold to travellers down the road,
this eventually becoming as well-known a delicacy as Cooper
Thornhill&rsquo;s &ldquo;Stilton&rdquo; cheeses.&nbsp; He called
this spirit &ldquo;Ram J&aacute;n,&rdquo; which seems to be an
Indian term for a table servant, and sold it in small bottles,
either singly, for consumption on the journey, or in cases of
half-dozens or dozens.&nbsp; The secret of this liqueur was
imparted to his son, but afterwards died out, and it is said that
&ldquo;Ram Jam&rdquo; ceased to be sold before the beginning of
the nineteenth century.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Although the &ldquo;Ram Jam&rdquo; was never more than a
tavern of a very humble description, and probably never sheltered
guests above the rank of cattle-drovers, it is noted as having
been the house where Molyneux, the black, slept before his fight
with Tom Cribb at Thistleton Gap, three and a half miles away, on
September 28, 1811.&nbsp; Cribb, who was easily the victor, had
his quarters at the &ldquo;Blue Bull,&rdquo; another small
roadside house, which stood, until the beginning of 1900, at the
cross roads on Witham Common, where roads go right and left to
Bourn and Melton Mowbray.&nbsp; It has now been demolished.</p>
<p>Here we have passed the little Rutlandshire village of
Stretton on the right, which obtained its name of
&ldquo;Street-town&rdquo; from having been on the ancient road
called the Ermine Way.&nbsp; Here we come again into
Lincolnshire.</p>
<p>For some twenty miles the Great North Road runs through this
broad county, the land of the &ldquo;yellow-bellies,&rdquo; as
Lincolnshire folk are named, from the frogs and eels that inhabit
their fens and marshes.&nbsp; North and South Witham, giving a
name to Witham Common, lie unseen, off to the left, and the once
famous old &ldquo;Black Bull&rdquo; stands, as it always has
stood, solitary beside the road, out of sight from any other
house.&nbsp; It consists of two separate buildings, at right
angles to one another and erected at different times.&nbsp; <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>The
original house is a structure of rag-stone, placed a little way
back from the road, and facing it.&nbsp; The second building,
which bears a more imposing architectural character, and with its
handsome elevation of red brick and stone, bears witness to the
once extensive business of the &ldquo;Black Bull,&rdquo; stands
facing south, with its gable-end to the road, thus forming two
sides of a courtyard.&nbsp; Long ranges of stables extend to the
rear.&nbsp; The place is now in use as a farmhouse and
hunting-box, and a screen of laurels and other evergreen shrubs
is planted on the site of the old coach-drive.&nbsp; Sturtle, who
kept the house in the old days, is gathered to his fathers, and
the railway whistle sounds across country, where the
guards&rsquo; horns once aroused the echoes of Morkery Woods or
Spittle Gorse.</p>
<p>How different the outlook now from the time when Sir Walter
Scott made entries in his <i>Journal</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Old
England,&rdquo; he writes, from his hotel at Grantham, &ldquo;is
no changeling.&nbsp; Things seem much the same.&nbsp; One race of
red-nosed innkeepers are gone, and their widows, eldest sons, or
head waiters exercise hospitality in their room, with the same
bustle and importance.&nbsp; The land, however, is much better
ploughed; straight ridges everywhere adopted in place of the old
circumflex of twenty years ago.&nbsp; Three horses, however, or
even four, are often seen in a plough, yoked one before the
other.&nbsp; Ill habits do not go out at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few years later, and these things, which had changed so
little, were revolutionised.&nbsp; The railway carried all the
traffic and the roads were deserted, the &ldquo;red-nosed
innkeepers&rdquo; so rarely seeing a guest, that when a stray one
arrived they almost fell on his shoulder and wept.&nbsp;
Agriculture, too, converted even Witham Common into a succession
of fertile fields, and thus banished wayfaring romance to the
pages of history or of sensation novels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Let</span> us rest awhile by this sunlit
stretch of road, where the red roofs of distant farmsteads alone
hint of life; always excepting the humming telegraph wires
whispering messages to Edinburgh and the Far North, or perhaps
the summer breeze bringing across country the distant echo of a
train.&nbsp; If it does, why then the sound renders our solitude
the more complete, and gives flight to a lagging
imagination.&nbsp; It reminds us that it was here, and not there,
three miles away over the meadows in a railway cutting, that the
traffic of two kingdoms went, sixty years ago.</p>
<p>These green selvedges of grass that border the highway so
delightfully were not then in existence.&nbsp; They were a part
of the road itself, which was, for all that, not too wide for the
mail-coaches, the stages, the fly-wagons, private chariots,
post-chaises, and especially the runaway couples <i>en route</i>
for Gretna Green, who travelled along it.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
dullest road in the world, though the most convenient,&rdquo;
quoth Sir Walter Scott, in his diary, when journeying to
Abbotsford in 1826.&nbsp; Dull scenically, but not
historically.&nbsp; Had it been an unlettered cyclist who had
made this criticism, a thousand critical lashes had been his
portion&mdash;and serve him right; but what shall we say of the
author of <i>Waverley</i>?&nbsp; Dull! why, the road is thronged
with company.&nbsp; One can&mdash;any one can who has the will to
it&mdash;call spirits from the vasty deep with which to people
the way.&nbsp; No need to ask, &ldquo;Will they
come?&rdquo;&nbsp; They cannot choose but do so; they are
here.</p>
<p>A strange and motley crowd: the pale ghosts of the ages.&nbsp;
From Ostorius Scapula and the Emperors Hadrian, Severus, and
Constantine the Great, down through the Middle Ages, they come,
mostly engaged in cutting one another&rsquo;s throats.&nbsp; York
and Lancaster, as their fortunes ebbed or flowed, setting up or
taking <a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>down the heads of traitors; obscure murderers
despatching equally obscure victims by the way, and in later
times&mdash;the farcical mingling with the more tragic
humours&mdash;we see James the First journeying to his throne,
confirmed in his good opinion of himself as a second Solomon by a
sycophantic crowd of courtiers; Lord Chancellor Littleton,
fleeing from Parliament to Charles the First at York, carrying
with him that precious symbol of Royal authority, the Great Seal
(the third Great Seal of that reign), made in the year the Long
Parliament began to sit; Charles the First, a few years later,
conducted by the victorious Parliament to London, and, at the
interval of another century, the Rebel Lords.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
&rsquo;45,&rdquo; indeed, made much traffic on this road: the
British army going down, with Billy the Butcher at its head, to
crush the rebellion, and the prisoners coming up&mdash;their last
journey, as they knew full well.&nbsp; They were pinioned on the
way, for their better custody, and so that Hanoverian heads might
sleep the sounder at St. James&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The Hanoverians
themselves rarely came this way, nor would their coming have
added greatly to the romance of the road.&nbsp; George the Third
passed once.&nbsp; He was a stay-at-home king, and of roads knew
little, save of those that led from London to Windsor, or to that
western <i>Ultima Thule</i> of his, Weymouth.&nbsp; Indeed, it is
said, on what authority it is difficult to determine, that the
third George never voyaged out of the kingdom.&nbsp; Even
Hanover, beloved of his forbears, he never knew, although the
Jacobites ceased not with their brass tokens, to wish him there.
<a name="citation165"></a><a href="#footnote165"
class="citation">[165]</a>&nbsp; His furthest journey is said to
have been to York.</p>
<p>His son, afterwards George the Fourth, had occasion to
remember this road, for he was upset on it in 1789, when
returning from a visit to Earl Fitzwilliam at Wentworth
Woodhouse.&nbsp; Two miles from Newark, a cart overturned his
carriage in a narrow part of the <a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>highway.&nbsp; It rolled over three
times down an incline, and fell to pieces like a box of tricks,
but the prince was unhurt.</p>
<p>Of bygone sporting figures with which, in imagination, to
people the way we have a crowd.&nbsp; There has always been
something in the great length of the road to York, and of its
continuation to Edinburgh, that has appealed to sportsmen and all
those interested in the speeds of different methods of
progression.&nbsp; Pedestrians, horsemen, and coaches&mdash;and
in recent times cyclists&mdash;have competed in their several
ways, from an early period until our own day, and the rival
railways even have had their races to Edinburgh.</p>
<p>Of these feats, that of Sir Robert Cary, son of Lord Hunsdon,
is not the least remarkable.&nbsp; He carried the news of Queen
Elizabeth&rsquo;s death to James at Edinburgh, and was the first
to hail him King of England.&nbsp; Riding in furious haste, and
with fresh horses wherever he could obtain them, he succeeded in
covering the distance in the sixty hours between a Thursday
morning and a Saturday night.&nbsp; Again, a very few years
later&mdash;in May 1606&mdash;a certain esquire of James the
First&rsquo;s, John Lepton of York, undertook for a wager to ride
on six consecutive days between that city and London.&nbsp; He
started from Aldersgate on the 20th of May, and accomplished his
task every day before darkness had fallen; &ldquo;to the greater
praise of his strength in acting than to his discretion in
undertaking it,&rdquo; as Fuller remarks.&nbsp; He also, of
course, had relays of horses.&nbsp; Among the pedestrians is Ben
Jonson, who walked to Scotland, on his visit to Drummond of
Hawthornden, starting in June 1618; but he footed it less for
sport than from necessity.</p>
<p>When Charles the First was at York, according to Clarendon, it
was a frequent occurrence for gentlemen couriers to ride with
despatches between that place and London, completing the double
journey&mdash;400 miles&mdash;in thirty-four hours.&nbsp; Thus, a
letter sent by the Council in London on the Saturday, midnight,
was answered on its arrival at York by the king, and the <a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>answer
delivered in London at ten o&rsquo;clock on the Monday
morning.</p>
<p>Then there was Cooper Thornhill, landlord of the
&ldquo;Bell&rdquo; at Stilton, who for a wager rode to London and
back again to Stilton, about 1740.&nbsp; The distance, 154 miles
in all, was done in eleven hours thirty-three minutes and
forty-six seconds.&nbsp; He had nineteen horses to carry him, and
so is no rival of Turpin&rsquo;s mythical exploit in riding to
York on his equally mythical Black Bess; but he was evidently
considered a wonderful person, for there was a poem published
about him in 1745, entitled &ldquo;The Stilton Hero: O
Tempora!&nbsp; O Mores:&rdquo; a sixpenny quarto of fourteen
pages.</p>
<p>Foster Powell is easily first among the pedestrians.&nbsp; He
was an eighteenth century notability, a native of Horsforth, near
Leeds, and born in 1734.&nbsp; Articled to an attorney, he
remained a solicitor&rsquo;s clerk, undistinguished in the law,
but early famed for his walking powers.&nbsp; In 1764 he backed
himself for any amount to walk fifty miles on the Bath Road in
seven hours, and having accomplished this, despite his wearing a
heavy greatcoat and leather breeches at the time, he visited
France and Switzerland, and fairly walked the natives off their
legs.&nbsp; It was in 1773 that he performed his first walk from
London to York and back, doing the 400 miles in five days and
eighteen hours.&nbsp; This was followed by a walk of 100 miles,
out and home, on the Bath Road, done in twenty-three hours and a
quarter.&nbsp; His three great pedestrian records on the Great
North Road in 1788 and twice in 1792 are his most remarkable
achievements.&nbsp; Although by this time he had long passed the
age at which athletics are commonly indulged in, he performed the
London to York and back walk of 1788 in five days twenty hours,
and its repetitions of 1792 in five days eighteen hours and five
days fifteen hours and a quarter, respectively.&nbsp; The
starting and turning-points were Shoreditch Church and York
Minster.&nbsp; This last effort probably cost him his life, for
he died, <a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>aged fifty-nine, early the following year.&nbsp; Powell
figures&mdash;rightly enough&mdash;as one of Wilson and
Caulfield&rsquo;s company of &ldquo;Remarkable Characters,&rdquo;
in which he is described as about five feet nine inches in
height, close-knit body, of a sallow complexion, and of a meagre
habit.&nbsp; He lived on a light and spare <a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>diet, and
generally abstained from drink, only on one of his expeditions
partaking of brandy.&nbsp; He took but little sleep, generally
five hours.</p>

<p>Robert Barclay of Ury, born 1731, died 1797, walked from
London to Ury, 510 miles, in ten days.&nbsp; He is described as
having been well over six feet in height.&nbsp; He married, in
1776, Sarah Ann Allardice, and was the father of the next notable
pedestrian.</p>
<p>Captain Barclay of Ury, an eighteenth century stalwart, born
in 1779 and living until 1854, walked the whole way from
Edinburgh to London and back.&nbsp; He was at the time Member of
Parliament for Kincardineshire.&nbsp; Another of his feats of
endurance was driving the mail for a wager from London to
Aberdeen.&nbsp; He then offered to drive it back for another
wager, but Lord Kennedy, who had already lost, was not inclined
to renew.&nbsp; Barclay started the &ldquo;Defiance&rdquo; coach
between Edinburgh and Aberdeen in July 1829.&nbsp; He only once
upset it, and thus described the event:&mdash;&ldquo;She fell as
easy as if she had fallen on a feather bed, and looking out for a
soft place, I alighted comfortably on my feet.&rdquo;&nbsp; A
favourite axiom with him was that no man could claim to be a
thoroughly qualified coachman until he had
&ldquo;floored&rdquo;&mdash;that is, upset&mdash;his coach;
&ldquo;for till he has done so he cannot know how to get it up
again.&rdquo;&nbsp; Barclay was the claimant of the Earldom of
Monteith and Ayr, and it was a source of genuine anxiety with him
whether, in the event of his proving his claim, he would have to
give up the reins.&nbsp; He consulted his friend the Duke of
Gordon on this point.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; replied his Grace,
&ldquo;there is not much difference between an earl and a
marquis, and as the Marquis of Waterford drives the Brighton
&lsquo;Defiance,&rsquo; I see no reason why you may not drive its
Aberdeen namesake.&nbsp; At all events, if there be any objection
to your being the coachman, there can be none to your being the
guard.&rdquo;&nbsp; Barclay was snubbed!</p>
<p>As for the many great people who were furiously driven back
and forth, up and down the road, the <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>historian is dismayed at the
prospect of chronicling their whirling flight.&nbsp; Let us
respectfully take the most of their performances on trust.&nbsp;
There was no occasion for all this haste, save the spirit of the
thing, as Byron hints:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Now there is nothing gives a man such
spirits,<br />
Leavening his blood as cayenne doth a curry,<br />
As going at full speed&mdash;no matter where its<br />
Direction be, so &rsquo;tis but in a hurry,<br />
And merely for the sake of its own merits;<br />
For the less cause there is for all this flurry,<br />
The greater is the pleasure in arriving<br />
At the great end of travel&mdash;which is driving.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus there was Lord Londonderry, who made a speech in the
House one night, and the next evening was at his own place in
Durham, 250 miles or so away, having travelled down in his
&ldquo;chariot and four.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were those, however, who scorned these effeminate
methods.&nbsp; Like Barclay of Ury, they walked or rode
horseback, long after the introduction of coaches.&nbsp;
Foul-mouthed old Lord Monboddo, for instance, a once famous Scots
Lord of Session, persisted in the use of the saddle.&nbsp; He
journeyed between the two capitals once a year, and continued to
do so until well past fourscore years of age.&nbsp; On his last
journey to London he could get no further than Dunbar, and when
his nephew asked him why he gave up, &ldquo;Eh, George,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;I find I am noo auchty-four.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was,
in fact, suffering from the incurable disease of &ldquo;Anno
Domini.&rdquo;&nbsp; He held it unmanly &ldquo;to sit in a box
drawn by brutes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Would that we could have his shade
for a companion on a &rsquo;bus ride from Charing Cross to the
Bank!</p>
<p>At that period the stage-wagons performed the journey in
fourteen days, carrying passengers at a shilling a day.</p>
<h2><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>XXV</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> list of equestrians is long and
distinguished.&nbsp; Lord Mansfield rode up from Scotland to
London when a boy, on a pony, and took two months over the
enterprise.&nbsp; Dr. Skene, who left town in 1753 in the same
fashion, reached Edinburgh in nineteen days.&nbsp; His expenses,
having sold his mare on arrival for eight guineas&mdash;exactly
the sum he had given for her&mdash;amounted to only four
guineas.</p>
<p>This, indeed, was the usual plan to purchase a horse for the
journey and to sell it on arrival; a method so canny that it must
surely be of Scots invention.&nbsp; It had the advantage that, if
you found a good market for your nag, it was often possible to
make a profit on the transaction.</p>
<p>But it behoved the purchaser to make some inquiry as to the
previous owners, as no doubt the Scotsman, leaving London with
one of these newly bought mounts, discovered, after some
embarrassing experiences.&nbsp; He went gaily forth upon his way,
and nothing befell him until Finchley Common was reached.&nbsp;
On that lonely waste, however, he met another horseman; whereupon
his horse began to edge up to the stranger, as though to prevent
him from proceeding.&nbsp; The Scotsman was at a loss to
understand this behaviour, but the other traveller, thinking him
to be a highwayman, was for handing over his purse
forthwith.&nbsp; This little difficulty explained away, our
friend resumed his journey, presently meeting a coach, when the
performance was repeated.&nbsp; This time, however, blunderbusses
were aimed at him, and, the nervous passengers being in no mood
to hear or understand explanations, he had a rather narrow escape
of his life.&nbsp; At Barnet he sold this embarrassing horse for
what he could get, and continued his journey by coach.</p>
<p>It was in 1756 that Mrs. Calderwood of Coltness travelled to
London from Edinburgh in her own <a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>post-chaise, her sturdy serving-man,
John Rattray, riding beside the vehicle on horseback, armed with
pistols and a broadsword by his side.&nbsp; She set out from
Edinburgh on the 3rd of June and reached London on the evening of
the 10th&mdash;an astonishing rapid journey, it was
thought.&nbsp; Let it not be supposed that the armed serving-man,
or the case of pistols the good dame carried with her inside the
vehicle, showed an excess of precaution.&nbsp; Not at all; as was
instanced near that suspicious place, Bawtry, in whose
neighbourhood a doubtful character whom they took to be a
highwayman made his appearance.&nbsp; However, when John Rattray
began talking ostentatiously about powder and ball to the
post-boy, the supposed malefactor was nonplussed; and on John
Rattray furthermore &ldquo;showing his whanger,&rdquo; the fellow
made off.&nbsp; And so Cox&mdash;and Box&mdash;were
satisfied.&nbsp; Strangest of all travellers, however, was Peter
Woulfe, chemist, mineralogist, and eccentric, whose specific for
illness was a journey by mail-coach.&nbsp; He indulged this whim
for years, riding from London to Edinburgh and back, until 1803,
when the remedy proved worse than the disease, for he caught cold
on these bleak miles and died.</p>
<p>John Scott, afterwards Earl of Eldon and created Lord
Chancellor, left a record of his early travels along this
road&mdash;surely it were better named the Road to Fortune!&nbsp;
He left school at Newcastle in 1766 to proceed to London on the
way to Oxford, and travelled in a &ldquo;fly,&rdquo; so called
because it did the journey in the previously unheard-of time of
three days and four nights.&nbsp; This &ldquo;fly&rdquo; had
probably once been a private carriage, for it still bore the
motto, &ldquo;<i>Sat cito</i>, <i>si sat
bene</i>&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say, &ldquo;Quick enough, if
well enough&rdquo;&mdash;exquisitely appropriate, however, to
that slow pace.&nbsp; Young Scott had noticed this, and made an
impudent remark to a fellow-traveller, a Quaker, who, when they
halted at Tuxford, had given sixpence to a chamber-maid, telling
her that he had forgotten to give it her when he had slept at <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>the inn two
years before.&nbsp; &ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; said he to the Quaker,
&ldquo;have you seen the motto on this coach?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then look at it,&rdquo; he rejoined, &ldquo;for I think
giving her sixpence now is neither sat cito nor sat
bene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is astonishing, indeed, how many future Lord Chancellors
came from the North.&nbsp; Lord Chancellor Campbell, who as a boy
came up to London from Fife in 1798, was among the early arrivals
by mail-coach.&nbsp; At that time his father was the admiration
of his Fifeshire village, for he was the only one in the place
who had been to London.&nbsp; Every one, accordingly, looked up
to, and consulted, so great a traveller.&nbsp; He had seen
Garrick, too, and was used to boast of the fact, although, it is
to be supposed, with discretion and amid the inner circle of his
friends, for play-actors were not yet favourites in the dour
Scottish mind.&nbsp; Great was the excitement when young Campbell
left home.&nbsp; The speed of the coaches had been accelerated,
and they now began to reach London from Edinburgh in two days and
three nights.&nbsp; Friends advised him to stay in York and
recuperate for a day or two after a taste of this headlong speed,
lest he&mdash;as it was rumoured had happened to
others&mdash;should be seized with apoplexy from the rush of air
at that rate of travelling.&nbsp; But, greatly daring, he
disregarded their advice, and came to town direct and in
safety.</p>
<p>When railways were introduced, they meant much more than cheap
and speedy travelling; they prefigured a social revolution and an
absolute reversal of manners and customs.&nbsp; The &ldquo;great
ones of the earth&rdquo; were really great in the old days;
to-day no one is great in the old exclusive sense.&nbsp; Every
one can go everywhere&mdash;and every one does.&nbsp; Dukes
travel in omnibuses and go third-class by train because there is
no fourth.&nbsp; If there <i>were</i>, they would go by it, and
save the difference.</p>
<p>The judges kept up the practice of going on circuit in their
carriages for some little while after railways had rendered it
unnecessary; and barristers who used <a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>to post to the assizes were for a
few years unwilling to be convinced that it was quite respectable
and professional to go by train.&nbsp; The juniors were the
readiest converts, for the difference in cost touched them
nearly.&nbsp; The clergy soon embraced the opportunity of
travelling cheaply, for the cloth has ever had, at the least of
it, a due sense of the value of money.</p>
<p>Dignified and stately prelates therefore speedily began to
look ridiculous by contrast, and the old picture in <i>Punch</i>,
once considered exquisitely humorous, of a bishop carrying a
carpet-bag, has lost its point.&nbsp; Samuel Wilberforce, when
elevated to the Bishopric of Oxford in 1845, was probably the
first Bishop to give up his coach and four and his gorgeous
lackeys.&nbsp; He rode, unattended, on horseback, and scandalised
those who saw him.&nbsp; How much more scandalised would they
have been to see bishops ride bicycles: a sight not uncommon in
our time.</p>
<p>In the vanished era, only those who could afford it travelled;
in the present, only those who <i>cannot</i> afford it go
&ldquo;first.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jack is as good as his
master&mdash;&ldquo;and a d&mdash;d sight better,&rdquo; as the
Radical orator said.&nbsp; Caste, happily, is breaking down, and
their privileges are being stripped from the governing cliques
who for centuries have battened on the public purse.&nbsp;
Perhaps it was because they had a prophetic fore-knowledge of all
this that the titled and other landowners so strenuously
withstood railways at their beginning.&nbsp; They sometimes
opposed railways so successfully that great trunk routes, planned
to go as direct as possible between two points, were diverted and
made circuitous.&nbsp; When the Great Northern Railway was
projected it was proposed to follow the highway to the North as
nearly as possible, and to go through Stamford; but the Marquis
of Exeter opposed the Bill as far as it concerned his own
property, and procured a deviation which sent the main line
through Grantham, with the results that Stamford languishes while
Grantham is made to flourish, and that the <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>short-sightedness of the then Marquis has wofully
affected the value of his successor&rsquo;s property.&nbsp; If
the thing were to do again, how eagerly would the Company be
invited to take the route it was once forbidden!</p>
<h2>XXVI</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span>, none of us, who read the story
of the roads, or who make holiday along them, would really like
those old times back, when railways were undreamt of, and
travelling for the pleasure of it was unknown.&nbsp; It is
sufficient to read the old travellers&rsquo; tales, to realise
what discouragements from leaving one&rsquo;s own fireside
existed then.&nbsp; There was, for instance, toward the close of
the seventeenth century, and well on into the eighteenth, an
antiquary of repute who lived at Leeds, and journeyed very
frequently in the Midlands, Ralph Thoresby was his name.&nbsp; He
travelled much, and in all weathers, and knew the Great North
Road well.&nbsp; In his day the coaches were often, through the
combined badness of the roads and the severity of the weather,
obliged to lay up in the winter, like ships in Arctic seas.&nbsp;
Like his much more illustrious contemporary, Pepys, he not
infrequently lost his way, owing to the roads at that period
having no boundary, and once, he tells us, he missed the road
between York and Doncaster, fervently thanking God for having
found it again.&nbsp; Indeed, all his journeys end with more or
less hearty thanksgivings for a safe return.&nbsp; On one
occasion we find him missing his pistols at an inn, and darkly
suspecting the landlord to be in league with thieves and
murderers; but he finds them, after a nerve-shaking search, and
proceeds, thanking the Lord for all his mercies.&nbsp; At another
time, journeying to London, he passes, and notes the
circumstance, &ldquo;the great common where Sir Ralph Wharton
slew the highwayman.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was doubtless Witham
Common, but, although he alludes to the <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>subject as
though it were in his time a matter of great notoriety, all
details of this encounter are now sadly to seek, and Sir Ralph
Wharton himself lives only in Thoresby&rsquo;s diary.</p>
<p>Thoresby was a very inaccurate person.&nbsp; He mentions
&ldquo;Stonegate Hole, between Stamford and Grantham,&rdquo; but
he is out of his reckoning by forty miles or so, Ogilby&rsquo;s
map of 1697 marking the spot near Sawtry.&nbsp; Accordingly when
we find him, going by coach, instead of by his usual method, on
horseback, in May 1714, and noting &ldquo;we dined at Grantham:
had the usual solemnity (this being the first time the coach
passed in May), the coachman and horses being decked with ribbons
and flowers, the town music and young people in couples before
us,&rdquo; we shrewdly suspect he was referring to the
festivities of this kind held at Sutton-on-Trent, twenty-three
miles further north.</p>
<p>Witham Common passed, we come to the village of Colsterworth,
built on a rise, with fine views from it of the upland copses and
gentle hills and dales of this hunting country, where the
Cottesmore, the Atherstone, and the Quorn overrun one
another&rsquo;s boundaries.&nbsp; Colsterworth is the last of the
stone-built villages for many a mile to come, red brick reigning
from Grantham onwards, to far beyond York.&nbsp; It is a
narrow-streeted village, with an old church, closely elbowed by
houses beside the road; the church where Sir Isaac Newton and his
ancestors worshipped, and where, on the wall of the Newton
Chapel, may yet be seen one of the sundials he carved with a
penknife when only nine years of age.&nbsp; In a secluded nook,
nearly two miles to the left of the highroad, lies Woolsthorpe
Manor House, the Newtons&rsquo; ancestral home, now a small
farmhouse, with a tablet built into the wall of the room where
the philosopher was born.&nbsp; The famous apple-tree whose
falling fruit suggested the Law of Gravitation has long since
disappeared.</p>
<p>Lincolnshire now begins to thoroughly belie its <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>reputation
for flatness, the road descending steeply from Colsterworth and
rising sharply from Easton Park to the park of Stoke Rochford,
with another long sharp descent beyond, and a further rise of
some importance into Great Ponton, another of the very small
&ldquo;Great&rdquo; villages.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Great Ponton, or Paunton Magna, as it was formerly called, was
in early days the site of a Roman camp, and of a turnpike gate in
latter times.&nbsp; Both have gone to a common oblivion.&nbsp; If
the ascent to the tiny village by the highroad is steep, the
climb upwards to it by the country lanes from the lowlands on the
east, where the Great Northern Railway takes its easeful course,
is positively precipitous.&nbsp; Overlooking the pleasant vale
from its commanding eyrie stands the beautiful old church, in a
by-way off the main road; the church itself strikingly handsome,
but the pinnacled and battlemented tower its peculiar
glory.&nbsp; It is distinctly of the ornate Somersetshire type,
and a very late example of Perpendicular work.&nbsp; Having been
built in 1519, when Gothic had reached its highest development,
and Renaissance ideals were slowly but surely obtaining a hold in
this country, we find in its lavish ornamentation and abundant
panelling an attempt to combine the florid alien Renaissance
conventions with that peculiarly insular phase of Gothic, the
Perpendicular style.&nbsp; The result is, as it chances, happy in
this instance, the new methods halting before that little further
development which would have made this a debased example.&nbsp;
The building of this tower was the work of Anthony Ellys,
merchant of the staple, and of his wife, as a thank-offering for
a prosperous career, and of an escape from religious persecution;
and his motto, &ldquo;Thynke and thanke God of all,&rdquo; is
still visible, carved on three sides.&nbsp; His house, a
crow-stepped old mansion next the church, is still standing, and
recalls the legend of his sending home a cask from his warehouses
in Calais, labelled &ldquo;Calais sand.&rdquo;&nbsp; Arriving
home, he asked his wife what she had done with the
&ldquo;sand.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="page179"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>She had put it in the cellar.&nbsp;
He then revealed the fact that it contained, not sand, but the
greater part of his wealth.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Prominent on the south-east pinnacle of this tower is a
curious vane in the shape of a fiddle.&nbsp; The legend told of
it says that, many years ago, there wandered amid the fenland
villages of Lincolnshire a poor fiddler who gained a scanty
livelihood by playing at fairs and weddings, and not infrequently
in the parlours of the village inns on Saturday nights.&nbsp;
After some years of this itinerant minstrelsy, he amassed a
sufficient sum of money wherewith to pay his fare <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>as a
steerage passenger to the United States, to which country his
relatives had emigrated some time before.&nbsp; In course of
time, this once almost poverty stricken fiddler became rich
through land speculation in the backwoods; and, revisiting the
scenes of his tuneful pilgrimages in the new character of a
wealthy man, offered to repair this then dilapidated church, as
some sort of recognition of the kindnesses shown him in bygone
years.&nbsp; Only one stipulation was made by him, that a vane
representing his old fiddle should take the place of the
weathercock.&nbsp; This was agreed to, and, as we see, that
quaint emblem is there to this day.</p>
<p>Candour, however, compels the admission that this pretty
legend has no truth in it; but the story has frequently found its
way into print, and so is in a fair way to become a
classic.&nbsp; The original fell in 1899 and was broken.&nbsp;
The then rector would have replaced it with another vane of
different character, but the old folk were attached to their
fiddle, and so a replica was made by subscription, and fixed; and
there it is to-day: the first fiddle, said the rector, that ever
he heard of in the guise of a wind-instrument!</p>
<p>Among the many curious inn-signs along the road, that of the
&ldquo;Blue Horse,&rdquo; at Great Ponton, is surely one of the
most singular, and is a zoological curiosity not readily
explained.</p>
<h2>XXVII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Grantham</span>, one hundred and ten and a
quarter miles from London by road, and five miles less by rail,
is three miles and a half distant from Great Ponton.&nbsp;
Entered down the very long and steep descent of Spitalgate Hill,
the utterly modernised character of the town becomes at once
apparent, and all pleasurable anticipations based upon memories
of the lettered ease of Stamford are instantly dispelled.&nbsp;
The expectant traveller comes to Grantham hopeful of a fine old
town with streets and buildings befitting its <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>historic
dignity; but these hopes are soon dispelled by grimy engine-shops
and roads gritty with coal-dust, giving earnest of an aggressive
modernity fully unfolded when the level is reached and the town
entered at Spitalgate and St. Peter&rsquo;s Hill.&nbsp; Grantham
is a red-brick town, and modern red brick at that.&nbsp; A
cruelly vulgar Town Hall, all variegated brick, iron crestings,
and general spikiness, fondly believed to be
&ldquo;Italian,&rdquo; testifies at once to the expansive
prosperity of Grantham and to its artlessness.&nbsp; This
monument of Grantham&rsquo;s pride faces the grass-plots that
border the broad thoroughfare of St. Peter&rsquo;s Hill (which is
flat, and not a hill at all) where stand bronze statues of Sir
Isaac Newton, Grantham&rsquo;s great man, and of a certain
Frederick James Tollemache, M.P. for Grantham, who departed this
life in 1888, after having probably achieved some kind of local
celebrity which, whatever it may have been, has not sent the
faintest echo to the outer world.&nbsp; It is an odd effigy,
representing the departed legislator in an Inverness cloak, and
holding in his right hand a something which looks curiously like
a billiard-cue, but is probably intended for some kind of
official wand.&nbsp; The untutored might be excused for thinking
this a monument to a champion billiard-player.</p>
<p>Great are the Tollemaches in Lincolnshire, great
territorially, that is to say; for the Earls of Dysart, at the
head of the family, own many manors and broad acres; from Witham
and Buckminster, away along the road to Foston and Long
Bennington, and so to where the Shire Dyke divides the counties
of Lincolnshire and Nottingham, on the marches of the Duke of
Newcastle&rsquo;s estates.</p>
<p>To an Earl of Dysart, Grantham owes the ugly polished granite
obelisk in the market-place, with a lying inscription which
purports to mark the spot where the ancient Eleanor Cross
formerly stood, before it was utterly demolished by Puritan
fanatics in 1645.&nbsp; That spot was really on St. Peter&rsquo;s
Hill, at quite the other end of the town!</p>
<p><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>Grantham owes its name to the river on which it stands,
now the Witham, but once called the Granta, and its ancient
prosperity to its position on the road to the North.&nbsp; To
this circumstance is due also its long reputation as a town of
many and excellent inns, from those early times when the Church
was the earliest inn-keeper, to those others when the coaches
were at their best and &ldquo;entertainment for man and
beast&rdquo; a merely secular business.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Angel&rdquo; and the &ldquo;George&rdquo; at Grantham have
a long history.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Angel&rdquo; still survives as a
medi&aelig;val building, and, like the equally famous
&ldquo;George&rdquo; at Glastonbury, contrives to please alike
the antiquary and the guest whose desire for modern creature
comforts takes no account of Gothic architecture.&nbsp; Anciently
a wayside house of the Knights Templar, the existing building
belongs to the mid-fourteenth <a name="page183"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 183</span>and fifteenth centuries.&nbsp; On
either side of its great archway now appear the carved stone
heads of Edward the Third and the heroic Queen Philippa, and at
the crown of the arch, serving the purpose of a supporting corbel
to the beautiful oriel window above, is an angel, supporting a
shield of arms; not the old sign, indeed, but an architectural
adornment merely.&nbsp; This, and all the numerous
&ldquo;Angels&rdquo; and the several &ldquo;Salutations&rdquo; on
the road, derived from the religious picture-sign of the
Annunciation, of which the saluting angel in the &ldquo;Hail
Mary&rdquo; group in course of time alone remained.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Before coaches or carriages were, kings and courtiers on their
way north or south made the &ldquo;Angel&rdquo; their
headquarters, coming to it, of necessity, on horseback.&nbsp;
Thus, John held his Court here in the February of 1213, in the
building which preceded even this old one, and Richard the Third
signed Buckingham&rsquo;s death-warrant in 1483 in the great
room, now divided into three, and that once extended the whole
length of the frontage on the first floor.&nbsp; Perhaps it was
in the bay of this oriel window that he &ldquo;off&rsquo;d with
his head!&rdquo; in the familiar phrase mouthed by many
generations of gory tragedians and aspiring amateurs; and
exclaiming &ldquo;So much for Buckingham!&rdquo; turned on his
heel, in the attitude of triumphant villainy we know so
well.&nbsp; But, unhappily for the truth of this and similar
striking situations, it is to be feared that Richard,
unappreciative of the situation&mdash;the
&ldquo;situation,&rdquo; that is to say, in the theatrical
sense&mdash;signed the warrant in a businesslike way, and neither
mouthed nor struck attitudes.&nbsp; He left that scene to be
exploited by Shakespeare or Colley Cibber as authors, and by
Charles Kean and many another as actors.&nbsp; Between them,
<i>they</i> could have shown him how to play the part.</p>
<p>But let us to less dramatic&mdash;and safer&mdash;times.&nbsp;
The &ldquo;Angel&rdquo; divided the honours in coaching days with
the &ldquo;George,&rdquo; a house with a history as long, but not
so distinguished, as this old haunt of bloody minded
monarchs.&nbsp; The old &ldquo;George,&rdquo; burnt down in 1780,
was an equally beautiful house, and was <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>rebuilt in
the prevailing Georgian taste&mdash;or want of taste&mdash;that
raised so many comfortable but ugly inns toward the close of the
eighteenth century.&nbsp; &ldquo;One of the best inns in
England,&rdquo; says Dickens, in describing the journey from
London to Yorkshire in <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>, and there is not
wanting other testimony to its old-time excellence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the sign of the &lsquo;George&rsquo; you had a
cleaner cloth, brighter plate, higher polished glass, and a
brisker fire, with more prompt attention and civility than at
most other places,&rdquo; says one who had occasion to know; and
so the local proverb, current among towns and villages adjacent
to Grantham, &ldquo;Grantham gruel; nine grots and a gallon of
water,&rdquo; was evidently no reflection upon the quality of
this inn.&nbsp; The &ldquo;George&rdquo; was busy with the
coaches, early and late.&nbsp; First to arrive was the Edinburgh
mail, at twenty-three minutes past seven in the morning.&nbsp;
Three lengthened blasts of the horn announced its arrival, and
out stepped night-capped passengers, half asleep and surly, but
fresh water and good spirits dispelled the gloomy faces, and down
went, for the allotted period of forty minutes, hot rolls, boiled
eggs, and best Bohea; good fare after weary wayfaring, and
calculated to make the surliest good-tempered.</p>
<p>Francis, Lord Jeffrey, writing from his hotel (doubtless the
&ldquo;George&rdquo;) at Grantham, when journeying to London in
January 1831, is not so enthusiastic on old-time travel as he
might have been, considering the high character of
Grantham&rsquo;s inns.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;on our way to you; toiling up through snow and darkness,
with this shattered carcase and this reluctant and
half-desponding spirit.&nbsp; You know how I hate early rising;
and here have I been for three days, up two hours before the sun,
and, blinking by a dull taper, haggling at my inflamed beard
before a little pimping inn looking-glass, and abstaining from
suicide only from a deep sense of religion and love to my
country.&nbsp; To-night it snows and blows, and there is good
hope of our being blocked <a name="page185"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>up at Wytham Corner or Alconbury
Hill, or some of these lonely retreats, for a week or so, or
fairly stuck in the drift and obliged to wade our way to some
such hovel as received poor Lear and his fool in some such
season.&nbsp; Oh, dear, dear!&nbsp; But in the meantime we are
sipping weak black tea by the side of a tolerable fire, and are
in hopes of reaching the liberties of Westminster before dark on
Wednesday.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was writing on Monday evening!</p>
<p>At any rate such as he could afford to take his ease and
partake of the best.&nbsp; Those who needed pity were the poor
folk who had just enough for the journey, and could not afford to
stay at expensive inns, waiting until better weather came.&nbsp;
But, however much we may read in novels of the charm of winter
travelling in the old coaching days, if we turn to contemporary
accounts, by the travellers themselves, we shall always find that
even those who could afford the best did not like it.</p>
<p>Henry St. George Tucker, afterwards Chairman of the East India
Company, travelled from Edinburgh to London in 1816, in the depth
of winter.&nbsp; He wrote:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throughout the whole journey, as far as Newcastle, we
had a violent storm of snow, rain and sleet; and the cold was
more severe than I had felt it before.&nbsp; The coach was not
wind-tight at the bottom; and as I was obliged to keep my window
open to allow the escape of certain fumes, the produce of whisky,
rum, and brandy, I felt the cold so pinching that I should have
been glad of fur cap and worsted stockings.&nbsp; To aggravate
the evil, I had not a decent companion to converse with.&nbsp; We
picked up sundry vagabonds on the road, but there was only one,
between Edinburgh and York, who bore the &lsquo;slightest
appearance of being a gentleman.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; He, however,
we learn was &ldquo;effeminate and affected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Mozley&rsquo;s <i>Reminiscences</i> we find a horrid story
of the endurance practised by a woman travelling by coach from
Edinburgh to London.&nbsp; &ldquo;I once travelled,&rdquo; he
says, &ldquo;to London <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> with a thin, pale,
elderly <a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>woman, ill-clad in black, who never once got down, or
even moved to shake off the snow that settled on her lap and
shoulders.&nbsp; I spoke to the guard about her.&nbsp; He said
she had come from Edinburgh and had not moved since changing
coaches, which she would have to do once; she feared that if she
once got down she would not he able to get up again.&nbsp; She
had taken no food of any kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There the picture ends, and this tragical figure is
lost.&nbsp; Who was she who endured so much?&nbsp; Had she come
to London to purchase with her few savings the discharge of an
only son who had enlisted in the army?&nbsp; Had she made this
awful journey to bid good-bye to a husband condemned to death or
transportation?&nbsp; Surely some such story was hers, but we can
never know it, and so the gaunt figure, pathetic in its
endurance, haunts the memory and the baffled curiosity like an
enigma.</p>
<p>Grantham, it is true, has few things more interesting than its
inns.&nbsp; This is not the confession of a <i>bon vivant</i>,
suspicious though it sounds, but is just another way of stating
the baldness of Grantham&rsquo;s street.&nbsp; One of these few
things is the tall steeple of the parish church, which has a fame
rivalling that of some cathedrals miles away.&nbsp; Journeying by
road or rail, that lofty spire is seen, even while Grantham
itself remains undisclosed.&nbsp; If this were a proper place for
it much might be said of the church and spire of St.
Wulfran&rsquo;s: how the tower rises to a height of one hundred
and forty feet, and the slim crocketed spire to one hundred and
forty feet more; being sixth in point of measurement among the
famed spires of England.&nbsp; Salisbury is first, with its four
hundred and four feet, followed by Norwich, three hundred and
fifteen feet, Chichester, and St. Michael&rsquo;s, Coventry,
three hundred feet, and Louth, two hundred and ninety-two
feet.&nbsp; But generalities must serve our turn here.&nbsp; If
the spire is only sixth in point of measurement it is first in
date, being earlier than Salisbury&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Sir Gilbert
Scott held it to be second only to Salisbury in beauty, but <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>Scott&rsquo;s reputation in matters of taste had slight
foundations, and, beautiful though Grantham&rsquo;s spire is,
there are others excelling it.&nbsp; The majesty of
Newark&rsquo;s less lofty spire is greater than this of Grantham,
and indeed it may be questioned whether a Decorated spire,
comparatively so attenuated and with its purity of outline broken
and worried by an endless array of crockets is really more
admirable as a thing of beauty, or as a daring and successful
exercise in the piling up of fretted stones in so apparently
frail a fashion.</p>

</a></p>
<p>We cannot get away from the inns, and even the church is
connected with them, the town being annually edified by the
so-called &ldquo;Drunken Sermon&rdquo; preached at it in the
terms of a bequest left in the form of an <a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>annual
rent-charge of forty shillings on the &ldquo;Angel&rdquo; by one
Michael Solomon.</p>
<p>But among the popular curiosities of Grantham, few things are
more notable than the unpretending inn at Castlegate known
variously as the &ldquo;Beehive&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Living
Sign.&rdquo;&nbsp; Immediately in front of the house is a small
tree with a beehive fixed in its branches, and a board calling
attention to the fact in the lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Stop, traveller, this wondrous Sign
explore,<br />
And say, when thou hast viewed it o&rsquo;er and o&rsquo;er,<br
/>
&lsquo;GRANTHAM, now two rareties are thine,<br />
A lofty Steeple and a living Sign.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may fairly be advanced that the suggestion to
&ldquo;explore&rdquo; an inhabited beehive is an unfortunate
choice of a word.</p>
<p>There is (unless it has lately been abolished) another
curiosity at Grantham.&nbsp; It is a custom.&nbsp; When the
time-expired Mayor vacates his office, what has aptly been called
a &ldquo;striking&rdquo; ceremony takes place.&nbsp; His robe is
stripped off, his chain is removed from his shoulders, and with a
small wooden hammer the Town Clerk takes the ex-Chief Magistrate
on the head to typify the end of his authority.&nbsp; There is
only one possible method more derogatory than this humiliating
treatment, but it need not be specified.</p>
<h2>XXVIII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> history, Grantham and its
immediate neighbourhood are notable as having witnessed the rise
of Oliver Cromwell.&nbsp; At the outbreak of hostilities in March
1643, the town was taken and its fortifications demolished by the
Royalists, but was retaken shortly afterwards by the
Parliamentary troops under a hitherto undistinguished Cornet of
Horse, after some fighting at Gonerby.&nbsp; The rise of this
cornet is picturesquely described by De Foe.&nbsp; &ldquo;About
this <a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>time,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;it was that we began to
hear of the name of Oliver Cromwell, who, like a little cloud,
rose out of the East, and spread first into the North, until it
shed down a flood that overwhelmed the three
kingdoms.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was on May 22, 1643, that, with twelve
troops, Cromwell defeated at Gonerby twenty-four troops of the
opposing forces, and thus commenced this meteorological
career.</p>
<p>The ascent of Gonerby Hill, where these events took place, is
a part of the journey to the North.&nbsp; It begins at the
distance of a mile and a quarter beyond Grantham, shortly before
reaching the hundred and twelfth milestone from London.&nbsp; For
this part of the world it is a remarkable eminence, but although
a long continuous climb, it does not come up to the impressive
old descriptions of it, and cannot compare with such hills as
Reigate Hill, or with Boughton Hill on the Dover Road.&nbsp; The
village of Great Gonerby, a poor, out-at-elbows kind of a place,
stands on the crest of the hill, with its great spired church as
a landmark, a wide, bare street, a little inn with the curious
sign of the &ldquo;Recruiting Sergeant,&rdquo; and an old posting
inn, the &ldquo;Rutland Arms,&rdquo; its principal
features.&nbsp; Passing through the cutting by which the gradient
of the northern side of the hill has been eased, a remarkable
view is unfolded of that flat region, fertile as a land of
promise, the Vale of Belvoir.</p>
<p>We shall hear presently what Sir Walter Scott has to say of
Gonerby Hill, but in the meanwhile let us see how the view from
it struck another traveller, the Reverend Thomas Twining, an
amiable clergyman of Colchester, who in the eighteenth century
was in the habit of taking holidays along the roads, mounted on
his horse &ldquo;Poppet,&rdquo; and writing letters to his
friends, describing what he saw.&nbsp; He was here in 1776.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a view,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;somewhat
sublime and striking from its mere extent and suddenness but it
is flat as a pancake.&nbsp; The road is through level, moorish,
unpleasant ground from the bottom of that hill to Newark, but, as
road, excellent.&rdquo;&nbsp; No <a name="page190"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 190</span>guide-book ever pictured a view so
vividly as this description, which may stand unaltered
to-day.</p>
<p>Gonerby Hill&mdash;&ldquo;Gunnerby&rdquo; is the correct
pronunciation of the word&mdash;is something more to us in these
pages than merely a hill.&nbsp; It is a place of literary
eminence, whose terrors are enshrined in the pages of Scott and
Ainsworth.&nbsp; Jeanie Deans, of all the romantic and historic
characters that people this historic and romantic road the most
prominent, is especially to be identified with this height.&nbsp;
Historic she is because there is a substantial basis of truth in
the character of Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s heroine, and of Effie
and many another figure in the <i>Heart of Midlothian</i>.&nbsp;
They have fictitious names, but some were real persons.&nbsp;
Helen Walker, who died in 1791 and was buried in the churchyard
of Irongray, near Dumfries, is the prototype of Jeanie.&nbsp; She
had in 1737 walked to London and sought a pardon for her sister,
Isabella, condemned to death by the ferocious Scots law on a
<i>presumption</i> of having murdered her child.&nbsp; She
actually did (as Scott&rsquo;s heroine is described as having
done) seek the Duke of Argyle and through his interest obtain the
object of her journey; but Scott is responsible for the
embroidery of this simple and affecting story; for he never saw
Helen Walker, and she, with Scottish closeness, never described
her adventures, being only too anxiously concerned that the story
of her sister&rsquo;s shame should be forgotten.</p>
<p>It is a curious and (admirable or not, as one may personally
think it) unusual conscience that would hesitate to stretch a
point in evidence when to do so would be to save the life of a
loved sister; and more strange still to find so unbending a
moralist enduring the toils and dangers of a four-hundred
miles&rsquo; tramp with the bare possibility of preserving the
life of the sinner in view at the end; but to understand the
workings of the Scottish conscience is beyond the mental reach of
any one who does not chance to be either a Scot or a
Presbyterian.</p>
<p>And here let it be said that the Jeanie Deans of the <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>novel is by
no means so attractive a heroine as Scott wished to make
her.&nbsp; There is heroism in her walk from Scotland to London,
and we rejoice when she is fortunate enough to obtain a
&ldquo;cast in a wagon,&rdquo; or pity her when she falls in with
thieves and murderers at Gonerby Hill foot; but when we find her
&ldquo;conforming to the national (that is to say, the English)
extravagance of wearing shoes and stockings for the whole
day,&rdquo; we can scarce subdue a snort of contempt at the very
superior manner in which she thus yields to the popular prejudice
in favour of this extravagance in shoe-leather.&nbsp; Nor is she
a particularly lovable figure when she disputes theology with the
rector of Willingham, with all the assurance of a Doctor of
Divinity and all the narrow-minded bigotry of a Covenanter;
coming in these things perilously near the ideal of the perfect
prig.</p>
<p>We must here quote the landlord of the &ldquo;Saracen&rsquo;s
Head&rdquo; at Newark on Gonerby Hill.&nbsp; He spoke of it as
though it were some beetling eminence, resembling at the very
least a Snowdon or an Helvellyn.&nbsp; He called it a &ldquo;high
mountain,&rdquo; and indeed Scott has in putting this phrase into
mine host&rsquo;s mouth made him characteristic of his age.</p>
<p>The year of Jeanie Deans&rsquo; romantic expedition was 1737,
and then, and for long afterwards, travellers and all who had
business with the roads magnified hills in this manner.&nbsp;
They disliked hills, and so for that matter did most people, for
the appreciation of scenery was not yet born.&nbsp; &ldquo;When I
was young,&rdquo; said Wordsworth, many years later, &ldquo;there
were no lakes nor mountains,&rdquo; and it was Thomas Gray, the
author of the <i>Elegy</i>, who really was the first to discover
beauty instead of terror and desolation in them.</p>
<p>Jeanie Deans, on the other hand, was pleased to hear of
Gonerby Hill.&nbsp; Not, mark you, that she was educated up to an
appreciation of the picturesque.&nbsp; We know, in fact, that she
was not, because when she and the Duke of Argyle stood looking
down upon the lovely expanse of woods, meads, and waters seen <a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>from
Richmond Hill, all she could find to say was that
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s braw feeding for the cows.&rdquo;&nbsp; No,
when she learned with pleasure of the &ldquo;mountain&rdquo; she
was to cross, it was only for association&rsquo;s sake:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear there&rsquo;s a hill, for baith my
sight and my very feet are weary o&rsquo; sic tracts o&rsquo;
level ground&mdash;it looks a&rsquo; the way between this and
York as if a&rsquo; the land had been trenched and levelled,
whilk is very wearisome to my Scotch een.&nbsp; When I lost sight
of a muckle blue hill they ca&rsquo; Ingleboro&rsquo;, I thought
I hadna a friend left in this strange land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for the matter of that, young woman,&rdquo; said
mine host, &ldquo;an you be so fond o&rsquo; hill, I carena an
thou couldst carry Gunnerby away with thee in thy lap, for
it&rsquo;s a murder to post-horses.&nbsp; But here&rsquo;s to thy
journey, and mayst thou win well through it, for thou is a bold
and a canny lass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gonerby Hill was reputed the steepest bit between London and
Edinburgh.&nbsp; It was, at the time when Scott wrote, a great
deal steeper than nowadays, now that the road has been cut deeply
through it, instead of climbing painfully over the crest.&nbsp;
Then also, as he remarks, the open ground at its foot was
unenclosed and covered with copses and swampy pools.&nbsp; Also,
as Jeanie discovered, there was &ldquo;bad company&rdquo; where
the &ldquo;bonny hill lifted its brow to the moon.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But surely never did such odd company as Sir Walter has invented
lurk in these recesses.&nbsp; The <i>Heart of Midlothian</i>,
indeed, is a fantastic novel quite unworthy of the Wizard of the
North, and its wildly improbable characters and marvellous
rencounters are on a par with Harrison Ainsworth at his
worst.&nbsp; Syston, two miles away to the right, is, they say,
the original of the Willingham village in the novel, and
Barkston, close by, is doubtless the &ldquo;Barkston
town-end&rdquo; where Mother Murdockson was put in the stocks;
but the references to them are of the haziest.</p>
<p>It was not inadvisedly that Ainsworth was just mentioned, for
Gonerby Hill is named in Turpin&rsquo;s Ride.&nbsp; Ainsworth
always resorted to the gibbet when <a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>he wanted to make a point in the
gruesome.&nbsp; Accordingly, when Turpin mounts the rise, what
does he find but &ldquo;two scarecrow objects covered with rags
and rusty links of chain,&rdquo; depending from &ldquo;the
tree.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Will this be my lot, I wonder?&rdquo;
asks the hero with a shudder.&nbsp; We need only to be slightly
acquainted with Ainsworth&rsquo;s methods to know that a
melodramatic answer was immediately forthcoming.&nbsp; Springing
from the briars and tussocks of rank grass between the foot of
the gallows and the road, a gaunt figure exclaimed, &ldquo;Ay,
marry will it!&rdquo;&nbsp; These &ldquo;gaunt figures&rdquo;
never failed the novelist; but the plain man wants to know what
they were doing on these inclement spots, and by what unfailing
instinct they were always there at the precise moment demanded in
the interests of fiction.</p>
<p>The descent of Gonerby Hill accomplished, and the level
reached, a singularly featureless and flat twelve miles leads
into Newark, past Marston cross-roads, where a turnpike gate used
to trouble travellers, past Foston, a forlorn village on a knoll,
Long Bennington, a larger and still more forlorn village on the
flat, and thence, with the graceful spire of Claypole far on the
right, over the Shire Dyke, into Nottinghamshire, and through
Balderton.</p>
<h2>XXIX</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> approach to Newark is long and
dull, by way of the suburban &ldquo;London Road&rdquo; and past
the decaying Beaumond Cross, but this leads at length to the
great open square of the Market-place, the most striking of all
such centres of public resort to be found on the way to the
North.&nbsp; Newark-&ldquo;upon-Trent&rdquo; is a misnomer, for
neither the town nor the castle, which was once the &ldquo;new
work&rdquo; that gave the place its name, are on that river, but
only on a branch of it&mdash;the Devon&mdash;which falls into the
Trent at Crankley <a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>Point, some miles below the town.&nbsp; The &ldquo;new
work&rdquo; was only new some eight hundred years ago, when
Edward the Confessor&rsquo;s castle on the banks of the Devon was
built, or when it was rebuilt or enlarged by Bishop Alexander of
Lincoln, 1123&ndash;47.&nbsp; Bishops and other mighty
castle-builders in those times not infrequently built their own
prisons when piling up their grim fortresses, and so the Bishop
of Lincoln found, when King Stephen seized him and kept him in
durance within his own stronghold.&nbsp; A judiciously low diet
of bread and water, and confinement in an unhealthy dungeon below
the level of the river, soon broke the haughty Churchman&rsquo;s
spirit, and he transferred the castle to the Crown.</p>
<p>But Newark Castle has better claims to notice than as the
dungeon of one of those old bloody-minded prelates.&nbsp; As the
place where King John ended his evil life, we may well look upon
its ruined walls with interest.&nbsp; His rebellious barons
scattered on his approach in that year of 1216, and England
seemed in danger of a long continuance of its troubles under the
profligate king.&nbsp; But a surfeit of peaches brought that
wicked life to a hasty conclusion, and here, on the banks of the
sluggish Devon, one of the worst of English monarchs died.&nbsp;
We need not regard peaches with apprehension because John is said
to have died of them.&nbsp; We must consider whence they came;
from the monks of Swineshead Abbey, where the king had stayed on
his journey to Newark.&nbsp; Now, Holy Church had the very best
of reasons for hating that monarch, and from hatred to murder was
not a far cry in those days.&nbsp; So of peaches King John
doubtless died; but of peaches subtly flavoured with poison,
there is little doubt.</p>
<p>The castle was again seized by the barons, in the succeeding
reign, but they surrendered, after a week&rsquo;s siege, and by
the gift of the king, the Bishops of Lincoln received their own
again.&nbsp; Under Edward the Sixth it again became the property
of the crown, and when James the First &ldquo;progressed&rdquo;
through <a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>England to his throne, these walls sheltered him during
a week of festivity.</p>
<p>A lawless and discourteous, as well as a weak-minded king, as
we shall see.&nbsp; Crowds assembled during the festivities set
apart by the corporation, and a fellow was caught in the act of
pocket-picking.&nbsp; By order of the king, the unfortunate
wretch was strung up, instanter, without the veriest semblance of
a trial!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s your lawlessness, and here follows
the discourtesy.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>There was a certain Dame Eleanor Disney, who, to do honour to
this strange kind of king, came, splendidly dressed, with her
husband, Sir Henry, to one of the receptions.&nbsp; James&rsquo;s
eye lighted upon all this finery, and his frugal mind was
shocked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wha,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;be that lady
wi&rsquo; a lairdship to her bock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the most stirring of Newark&rsquo;s historic days were yet
to come.&nbsp; Newark to the last was loyal to Charles the
First.&nbsp; Three times was the town besieged by the Parliament,
and never taken.&nbsp; All the inhabitants armed and did
excellent service, making sorties and capturing troops of
Parliamentary horse; and had not the royal cause failed
elsewhere, Newark must have emerged, triumphant, at the
end.&nbsp; But at last all that remained were some few outlying
garrisons throughout the country.&nbsp; Newark was especially
commanded by the king to discontinue a hopeless resistance, and
accordingly the town laid down its arms in 1646.&nbsp; It was
then that the castle was ruined.</p>
<p>It is a highly picturesque ruin to-day, and lacking nothing in
itself of grandeur, only needs a more effective site.&nbsp; As it
stands, only slightly elevated above the river and the
surrounding levels, this historic castle has not the advantages
that belong to fortresses like Ludlow and Harlech, perched on
their rocky heights.&nbsp; But it has done its duty and still
serves to give a note of dignity to Newark town, as one
approaches it by the long straight levels of the road from the
north.&nbsp; It looks much the same to-day as when Rowlandson
made his sketch of it, with the <a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>coach dashing over the bridge, more
than a hundred years ago; the projecting Tudor oriel windows
still looking forth upon the sullen tide from the more ancient
walls, their crumbling stones scarce more decayed than
then.&nbsp; The old wooden bridge, however, that formerly spanned
the Devon, was pulled down and rebuilt in 1775.</p>
<p>The great glory of Newark is its beautiful church, with that
soaring spire which is visible for miles away, before the town
itself is glimpsed.&nbsp; Not so tall as Grantham spire, it is as
beautiful in its simpler style, and the church is better placed
in the town than that of Grantham.&nbsp; Especially striking is
the view across the great market-place, the grey Early English
and Decorated spire, with its numerous belfry-lights, and the
fine windows and bold arcading of the tower forming a splendidly
effective contrast with the seventeenth and eighteenth century
red-brick houses facing the square.&nbsp; Newark and Grantham
spires are really the products of an old-time rivalry between the
two towns.&nbsp; Either town is satisfied that it possesses the
best, and so the peace is kept throughout the ages.</p>
<p>A relic of old times is found in the custom at Newark known as
&ldquo;Ringing for Gofer.&rdquo;&nbsp; On six successive Sunday
evenings, beginning twelve Sundays before Christmas, the old
parish church bells are rung for one hour, complying with the
terms of a bequest left by a merchant named Gofer, over two
centuries ago.&nbsp; He had on one occasion lost his way at night
in Sherwood Forest, then infested by robbers of no very
chivalrous instincts, who required, not &ldquo;your money or your
life,&rdquo; but both.&nbsp; Just as he had given up hope, he
heard these bells of Newark, and by their sound he made his way
to safety.&nbsp; In memory of his deliverance he left a sum of
money for this bell-ringing.</p>
<p>The market-square has always been the centre of Newark&rsquo;s
life.&nbsp; It is singularly like the great market-square of
Nottingham, on a smaller scale, and, like it, is partly
surrounded by houses with a colonnaded <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>piazza.&nbsp; An empty void now, save on the weekly
market-day, that occasion finds its broad, cobble-stoned space
thickly covered with stalls, while groups of farmers throng the
pavements, and with their samples of corn displayed in the palms
of their hands sell and buy in immense quantities.&nbsp; In the
old times this vast empty square was peopled every day with
arriving or departing coaches, and its pavements beset with
passengers mounting or alighting, for the celebrated inns of
Newark were mostly situated here, and the chief of them are here,
even now, on the opposite side from the church, and adjoining one
another.&nbsp; Newark is said to have once had no fewer than
fifty inns.&nbsp; The classical Town Hall, built in 1773, on the
west side of the square, stands on the site of two of them, and
many others have been converted to different uses.&nbsp; Here on
the south side are the &ldquo;Clinton Arms,&rdquo; so called in
honour of the Duke of Newcastle&rsquo;s family, powerful in these
parts; the &ldquo;Saracen&rsquo;s Head,&rdquo; with a bust of an
alleged (but very pallid and mild-looking) Saracen on its
frontage; and the &ldquo;White Hart,&rdquo; most ancient of all
these existing hostelries.&nbsp; An inn of this name is spoken of
as existing here in 1113.&nbsp; A &ldquo;Saracen&rsquo;s
Head&rdquo; stood here, certainly as far back as 1341, but
unhappily the existing house only dates from 1721.&nbsp; This
house is the one mentioned by Sir Walter Scott, who says,
&ldquo;The travellers who have visited Newark more lately will
not fail to remember the remarkably civil and gentlemanly manners
of the person who now keeps the principal inn there, and may find
some amusement in contrasting them with those of his more rough
predecessor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us put on record the name of this remarkable person:
William Thompson, landlord from 1784 to 1819.&nbsp; His
&ldquo;more rough predecessor&rdquo; was perhaps the landlord who
dispensed such open-handed and free hospitality to Jeanie Deans,
when that somewhat priggish young woman stayed there, and on
leaving asked for her &ldquo;lawing.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a name="page199"></a><span

<p><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

rough&rdquo; person; &ldquo;Heaven help thee, wench! what
ca&rsquo;st thou that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is&mdash;I was wanting to ken what was to
pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pay?&nbsp; Lord help thee!&mdash;why, nought,
woman&mdash;we hae drawn no liquor but a gill o&rsquo; beer, and
the &ldquo;Saracen&rsquo;s Head&rdquo; can spare a mouthful
o&rsquo; meat to a stranger like thee, that cannot speak
Christian language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alas! whatever your language, the more smooth innkeepers of
Newark, in our times, do not do business on this principle.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Clinton Arms&rdquo; has seen many changes of
name.&nbsp; It was originally the &ldquo;Talbot,&rdquo; and as
such is mentioned in 1341.&nbsp; At a later date it became the
&ldquo;Kingston Arms.&rdquo;&nbsp; Byron often stayed there, and
writes from London in 1807, &ldquo;The &lsquo;Kingston
Arms&rsquo; is my inn.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was also the inn, during
the election contest of 1832, of Mr. Gladstone, soliciting for
the first time the suffrages of &ldquo;free and
independent&rdquo; electors, who duly returned him, in the Tory
interest.&nbsp; Newark thus gave him an opportunity in Parliament
of defending his father as a slave-owner, and of whetting his
youthful eloquence to a keen edge in extolling the principle of
slave-owning.&nbsp; The Newarkers were long proud of having
returned the &ldquo;statesman&rdquo; to the House, but history
will perhaps deny him that title.&nbsp; It has been denied, and
the term of &ldquo;egotistical politician&rdquo; found to fit
better.&nbsp; He set a fashion in surrender, and his country
reaped shame while he lived; but the bitterest harvest-home of
his methods has come, after his death, in the red vintage of
English blood.&nbsp; It was when standing for this pocket-borough
of the Duke of Newcastle&rsquo;s that Gladstone gave an early and
characteristic specimen of his peculiarly Jesuitical ways of
thought.&nbsp; He took the mail-coach on a Sunday from Newark for
London, and beguiled the tedium of the journey and the Sabbath by
discussing the question of Sunday travelling with a Tory
companion.&nbsp; Not <a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>merely did he severely condemn the
practice, but he also gave some tracts to his
fellow-traveller!&nbsp; He gives the facts himself: it is no
outsider&rsquo;s satire.&nbsp; Thus, in one moment of confidence,
he reveals not only what he is, but what he will be.&nbsp; He
implicitly announces that he is a law unto himself and that those
things are permitted to him which in others must be deadly
sins.&nbsp; In the very moment of crime he can present an
accomplice with a tract, and glow with all the fervour of one
helped to save a lost soul.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Ram,&rdquo; another old inn, is still standing,
opposite the castle, on Beast Market Hill.&nbsp; George Eliot
stayed here in September 1868, &ldquo;seeing some charming quiet
landscapes&rdquo; along the Trent.&nbsp; Quiet, undoubtedly.</p>
<p>Ridge, the printer and bookseller, Byron&rsquo;s first
publisher, who issued his <i>Hours of Idleness</i>, carried on
business in a fine old house still standing at a corner of the
square, and the house-door and the brass knocker at which the
new-fledged poet knocked exist to-day.</p>
<h2>XXX</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">By</span> Beast Market Hill, past the
castle and over the bridge, one leaves Newark for the
north.&nbsp; Level crossings of the railways now and again
bedevil the way, which is flat so far as the eye can
reach&mdash;and much farther, and the meadows on either side are
intersected by runlets and marshes, the road carried over them by
a succession of red-brick bridges.&nbsp; At a distance of one and
a half miles, the true Trent is crossed by a wooden bridge, and
South Muskham reached, where the level-crossing gates take the
place of the old turnpike.</p>
<p>The act of looking backwards at this point is a more pleasing
physical exercise than the mental retrospect is ever likely to
be, anywhere.&nbsp; Sir Walter <a name="page204"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 204</span>Scott perceived the beauty of the
view, for he introduces it in Jeanie Deans&rsquo; journey south,
and says, in a fine passage: &ldquo;The hundred-armed Trent and
the blackened ruins of Newark castle, demolished in the great
Civil War, lay before her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hundred-armed&rdquo; is a good and eloquent figure,
although on a prosaic calculation likely to be found an
exaggeration.&nbsp; Milton, indeed, writing a hundred and ninety
years or so before, gives the Trent but thirty arms, on which, it
must be allowed, Sir Walter&rsquo;s computation is a great
advance.&nbsp; But here is Milton&rsquo;s version:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Trent, which like some earth-born giant
spreads<br />
His thirty arms along the indented meads.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even Drayton, in his <i>Polyolbion</i>, does not more nearly
approach to Sir Walter&rsquo;s computation, in the
couplet:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The bounteous Trent, that in herself
enseams,<br />
Both thirty sorts of fish and thirty sundry streams.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shakespeare rather shirks the calculation, and contents
himself with describing it as the &ldquo;smug and silver
Trent.&rdquo;&nbsp; As for mere travellers, who did not happen to
be poets or to be engaged in the exploitation of scenery, they
regarded this stream merely with apprehension, and they did right
so to look upon it, for Trent often overflowed its thirty or
hundred arms, as the case might be, and converted the flats for
miles around into the semblage of a vast lake.&nbsp; Then,
indeed&mdash;if at no other time&mdash;Newark was
&ldquo;upon&rdquo; Trent, if not actually &ldquo;in&rdquo; it,
and all the many other towns and villages, which bear a similarly
composite title, were in like case.&nbsp; Doubtless it was on one
of these occasions in 1739, before the river was bridged here,
that the Newcastle wagon was lost at the ford, when the driver
and the horses all perished.&nbsp; Nearly thirty years later, on
the 6th of June 1767, the poet Gray, writing from London, before
starting on a <a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>journey in these parts, says:&mdash;&ldquo;Pray that
the Trent may not intercept us at Newark, for we have had
infinite rain here.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor are floods infrequent, even
now, and many a boating-party has voyaged down the Great North
Road between Newark and Carlton-upon-Trent.</p>
<p>North and South Muskham lie off the road to the right, and are
not remarkable, except perhaps for the fact that a centenarian,
in the person of Thomas Seals of Grassthorpe, who died in 1802,
age 106, lies in North Muskham churchyard.&nbsp; Cromwell, on the
other hand, which now comes in sight, although now a commonplace
roadside village of uninteresting, modern, red-brick cottages,
with an old, but not remarkable, church, has a place in
history.&nbsp; According to Carlyle, &ldquo;the small parish of
Cromwell, or Crumwell (the well of Crum, whatever that may be),
not far from the left bank of the Trent, simple worshippers still
doing in it some kind of divine service every Sunday,&rdquo; was
the original home of the Cromwell family, from which the great
Protector sprang.&nbsp; &ldquo;From this,&rdquo; he adds,
&ldquo;without any ghost to teach us, we can understand that the
Cromwell kindred all got their name.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the
hero-worshipper will look in vain for anything at Cromwell to
connect the place with that family.&nbsp; Not even a tablet in
the church; nothing, in fact, save the name itself survives.</p>
<p>Here is a blacksmith&rsquo;s forge, with the design of a huge
horseshoe encompasing the door, and this inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;F. NAYLOR<br />
Blacksmith</p>
<p>Gentlemen, as you pass by,<br />
Upon this shoe pray cast an eye.<br />
I&rsquo;ll make it wider,<br />
I&rsquo;ll ease the horse and please the rider.<br />
If lame from shoeing, as they often are<br />
You may have them eased with the greatest care.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence to Carlton-upon-Trent, Sutton-upon-Trent, Scarthing
Moor, and Tuxford is an easy transition of nearly eight miles,
with little scenery or history on <a name="page206"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 206</span>the way.&nbsp; An old posting-house,
now retired into private life, the level-crossing of Crow Park,
and an old roadside inn, the &ldquo;Nag&rsquo;s Head,&rdquo;
beside it are all the objects of interest at Carlton; while
Sutton is scarce more than a name, so far as the traveller along
the road is concerned.</p>
<p>Weston, a village at a bend and dip of the road, stands by
what was once Scarthing Moor, whose famous inn, the &ldquo;Black
Lion,&rdquo; is now, like the old-time festivities of
Sutton-on-Trent, only a memory.&nbsp; The farmers and cottagers
of Sutton-on-Trent long preserved the spring-time custom of
welcoming the coaches, and freely feasting guards, coachmen, and
passengers.&nbsp; It was an annual week&rsquo;s merrymaking, and
young and old united to keep it up.&nbsp; Coaches were compelled
to stop in the village street, and every one was invited to
partake of the good things spread out upon a tray covered with a
beautiful damask napkin on which were attractively displayed
plum-cakes, tartlets, gingerbread, exquisite home-made bread and
biscuits, ale, currant and gooseberry wines, cherry-brandy, and
sometimes spirits.&nbsp; These in old-fashioned glass jugs,
embossed with figures, had a most pleasing effect.&nbsp; As to
the contents, they were superlative.&nbsp; Such ale! such
currant-wine! such cherry-brandy!&nbsp; Half a dozen damsels, all
enchanting young people, neatly clad, rather shy, but courteously
importunate plied the passengers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eat and drink you must,&rdquo; says one who partook of
these <i>al fresco</i> hospitalities.&nbsp; &ldquo;I tasted
all.&nbsp; How could I resist the winning manners of the rustics,
with rosy cheeks and sparkling eyes?&nbsp; My poor stomach, not
used to such luxuries and extraordinaries at eleven o&rsquo;clock
in the morning, was, however, in fine agitation the remainder of
the ride, fifty miles.&nbsp; Neither time nor entreaties can
prevent their solicitations; they are issued to reward the men
for trifling kindnesses occasionally granted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scarthing Moor&rdquo; is a name of somewhat terrifying
sound; but, as with all the &ldquo;moors&rdquo; met with on <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>the Great
North Road, enclosure and cultivation have entirely changed its
character, and the &ldquo;moor&rdquo; is just a stretch of fields
undistinguishable from the surrounding country.&nbsp; It leads
presently to the little town of Tuxford-in-the-Clay, approached
up a steep rise passing under the bridge of the Lincolnshire and
East Coast Railway, and in view of Tuxford&rsquo;s Great Northern
Station, away on the right, perched on a windy and
uncomfortable-looking ridge.&nbsp; A red rash of recent brick
cottages has broken out at the foot of the rise, but Tuxford
itself, on the crest of the hill, seems unchanged since coaching
days, except that the traffic which then enlivened it has
gone.&nbsp; It is a gaunt, lifeless place, in spite of its three
railway stations, and stands where the roads cross on the height,
and the church, the &ldquo;Newcastle Arms,&rdquo; another inn
which arrogates the title of &ldquo;The Hotel,&rdquo; and the
private houses and shops of the decayed town face a wide open
street, and all shiver in company.&nbsp; But Tuxford has seen
gorgeous sights in its time.&nbsp; Witness the gay and lengthy
cavalcade that &ldquo;lay&rdquo; here in the July of 1503, when
the Princess Margaret was on her way to her marriage with the
king of Scotland.&nbsp; The princess stayed at the
&ldquo;Crown,&rdquo; demolished in 1587 by one of the storms
which hill-top Tuxford knows so well, and leaving us the poorer
by one ancient hostelry.&nbsp; Not that it would have survived to
this day had there been no storm, for the town itself was
destroyed by fire at a much later date, in 1702.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Newcastle Arms&rdquo; is one of those old houses
built for the reception of many and wealthy travellers in the
Augustan age of the road, and is by consequence many sizes too
large for present needs, so that a portion of the house is set
apart for offices quite unconnected with hotel business.&nbsp;
Even the roomy old church away on the other side of the broad
road seems on too large a scale for Tuxford, as it is, and the
stone effigies of the Longvilliers and the mouldy hatchments of
later families hanging on the walls of its bare chapels tell a
tale of vanished greatness.&nbsp; <a name="page208"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>There is a curious and clumsy
carving in this church, representing the martyrdom of St.
Lawrence.&nbsp; The Saint is shown on his gridiron (which
resembles nothing so much as a ladder) and wears a pleased
expression, as though he rather liked the process of being
grilled, while one tormentor is turning him and another blowing
up the fire with a pair of bellows.</p>
<p>After the church, the old red-brick grammar-school, founded by
&ldquo;Carolo Read&rdquo; in 1669, is the most interesting
building in Tuxford.&nbsp; &ldquo;What God hath built, let no man
destroy,&rdquo; says the inscription over the entrance, placed
there, no doubt, by the donor with a vivid recollection of the
destruction wrought in the Civil War of some twenty years
before.</p>
<p>The road leaves Tuxford steeply downhill and facing another
hill.&nbsp; Descending this, the villages of East and West
Markham are just visible, right and left; West Markham with a
hideous church like a Greek temple, its green copper dome
conspicuous for a long distance.&nbsp; At the foot of Cleveland
Hill, as it is called, is, or was, Markham Moor, for it was
enclosed in 1810, with the great &ldquo;Markham Moor Inn,&rdquo;
now looking very forlorn and lonely, standing at the fall of the
roads, where the turnpike gate used to be, and where the Worksop
road goes off to the left, and a battered pillar of grey stone
with a now illegible inscription stands.&nbsp; This may or may
not be the &ldquo;Rebel Stone,&rdquo; spoken of in old county
histories as standing by the wayside, bearing the inscription,
&ldquo;Here lieth the Body of a Rebel, 1746.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beyond this, again, is Gamston, a still decaying village, its
red-brick houses ruined or empty, the wayside forge closed and
the handsome old church on a hillock but sparsely attended; the
whole a picture of the failure and neglect which descended upon
the roadside villages fifty years ago.&nbsp; Many have found
other vocations, but Gamston is not of them.</p>
<p>For some one hundred and fifty years the Great North Road has
gone through Tuxford to East Retford <a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>and Barnby Moor; but this is not the
original road.&nbsp; That has to be sought, half-deserted, away
to the left.&nbsp; There is much romance on that old way, which
is one of several derelict branching roads just here.&nbsp; The
time seems to be approaching when this original road will be
restored, to effect a relief to the heavy traffic through
Retford.</p>
<p>We may branch off for the exploration of the old road either
at Markham Moor or at Gamston.&nbsp; Either turning will bring us
in two and a half miles to Jockey House, now a farmhouse, but
once an inn at what were cross-roads.&nbsp; Two of these roads
are grass tracks, but the old Great North Road on to Rushy Inn
and Barnby Moor is quite good, although very little used.</p>
<p>A substantial stone pillar stands at the corner of the
cross-roads opposite the Jockey House, inscribed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">From<br />
London 142<br />
Miles<br />
and a half<br />
Coach Road<br />
Work/op Mannor<br />
Hou/e<br />
7 Miles 3 qrs<br />
176 &mdash;<br />
The Keys<br />

House.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;keys in the Jockey House&rdquo; means that here was
a turnpike-gate with no turnpike keeper.&nbsp; The taking of toll
seems to have been conducted from the inn.</p>
<p>In the churchyard of Elkisley, a mile or so distant, there is
a tombstone which refers to a tragedy in the Jockey House two
hundred years ago.&nbsp; It reads:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Here lieth the body of<br />
JOHN BARAGH,<br />
gentleman, who was murdered by<br />
Midford Hendry, officer of the Guards,<br />
on the 24th day of June, 1721.<br />
Age 29 years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hendry, it seems, was in command of a company of <a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>Guards
travelling south on the Great North Road.&nbsp; They had halted
for refreshment at Jockey House, and Hendry got into a violent
political discussion in the inn with Baragh, who was sitting
there, a complete stranger to him.&nbsp; In the course of their
high words, Hendry drew his sword and stabbed Baragh to the
heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Retford</span>, on the main road, is over
three miles distant from Gamston, past the more cheerful-looking
little hamlet of Eaton, and the outlying settlement by the
&ldquo;White House Inn,&rdquo; at the beginning of the long
approach to the town.</p>
<p>Retford is a town of varied industries, situated on either
bank of the river Idle, and by it divided into East and West
Retford.&nbsp; Engineering works, brick <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>and tile
making, and agricultural pursuits combine to render it
prosperous, if not progressive, for when Retford built its
elaborate Town Hall in 1867 it probably exhausted itself with the
effort.&nbsp; In this Square, on a plinth, stands the
&ldquo;Bread Stone,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Broad Stone,&rdquo; a
seventeenth century Plague Stone with a hollow at that time
filled with vinegar and water for the immersion of coins passing
in the market against infection.&nbsp; The town centres in its
Market Square, in which the old Town Hall stood.&nbsp; When that
building was pulled down a great amount of additional room was
obtained at the cost of a certain picturesqueness, to which
quality the town can now scarcely lay claim.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;White Hart,&rdquo; standing at this corner of the Market
Square, is the only relic of old coaching days.&nbsp; Its
modernised frontage does not give the house credit for the
respectable age which it really owns, and it is only when we
explore the stableyard, a picturesque and narrow passage,
extending from the Market Square to Bridgegate, that we see the
old-time importance of the &ldquo;White Hart.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
perhaps unique in one respect.&nbsp; Nowadays, the old innkeepers
are, of course, all dead.&nbsp; In some instances their families
carried on the business for a while, but soon afterwards all
these old coaching-houses passed into other hands.&nbsp; Even the
Percival family, innkeepers and coach-masters for some
generations at Wansford and at Greetham, no longer have the
&ldquo;Haycock&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Greetham Inn,&rdquo; but the
&ldquo;White Hart&rdquo; is still in the Dennett family, and has
been since 1818, when William Dennett took it over.&nbsp; He
reigned here until 1848, and was succeeded by his son, Joseph
Dennett, who, dying in 1890, was in his turn followed by Arthur
Dennett, the present landlord.&nbsp; An old
coaching-house&mdash;the coaching-house of Retford&mdash;it
occupied a particularly favourable position on the main and
cross-country coach-routes: those of Worksop and Chesterfield on
the one hand, and Gainsborough, Market Rasen, and Boston on the
other.&nbsp; Besides being in receipt of the local coaching
business <a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>between Stamford and Doncaster, Joseph Dennett horsed a
stage of the Doncaster and Stamford Amity Coach and the Stamford
and Retford Auxiliary Mail, among others.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Although overshadowed by the neighbouring &ldquo;Bell&rdquo;
on Barnby Moor, kept by the mighty George Clark, this house did a
good posting business.&nbsp; For one <a name="page213"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 213</span>thing, the story of the &ldquo;White
Hart&rdquo; as a posting-house does not go back so far as that of
the &ldquo;Bell,&rdquo; for when Clark came to Barnby Moor he
found a fine business already developed, but the rise of the
&ldquo;White Hart&rdquo; into prominence dates only from the
coming of the Dennetts.&nbsp; Twelve post-horses and three boys
formed its ordinary posting establishment, and among them the
name of John Blagg is prominent.&nbsp; He left the
&ldquo;Bell&rdquo; at an early period and entered the service of
the &ldquo;White Hart&rdquo; in 1834, remaining for forty-five
years, and dying, at the age of seventy-five, in October
1880.&nbsp; The old posting-books of the house still show one of
his feats of endurance, the riding post from Retford to York and
back in one day, a distance of a hundred and ten miles.&nbsp;
When posting became a thing of the past, John Blagg was still in
request, and his well-remembered figure, clad in the traditional
postboy costume of white breeches, blue jacket, and white beaver
hat, was seen almost to the last at weddings and other
celebrations when riding postillion was considered
indispensable.&nbsp; Here he is, portrayed from the life, a
characteristic figure of a vanished era.</p>
<p>There are still some relics of that time at the &ldquo;White
Hart&rdquo;: the old locker belonging to the Boston coach, in
which the guard used to secure the valuables intrusted to him;
and in the sunny old booking-office looking out upon the Market
Square there are even now some old posting-saddles and
postboys&rsquo; whips.</p>
<h2>XXXII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Leaving</span> Retford by Bridgegate, the
road rises at once to the long five-miles&rsquo; stretch of
Barnby Moor, home of howling winds and whirling snow-wreaths in
winter, and equally unprotected from the fierce glare of the
midsummer sun.&nbsp; At the further end of this trying place,
just past a huddled group of cottages at the bend of the road,
stands the famous old <a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>&ldquo;Blue Bell&rdquo; inn.&nbsp;
But no one was ever heard to talk of this old coaching hostelry
as the &ldquo;Blue Bell.&rdquo;&nbsp; The &ldquo;Bell,&rdquo;
Barnby Moor, was the title by which it was always known.</p>
<p>For the beginning of the well-earned fame of the
&ldquo;Bell&rdquo; we must go back a long way.&nbsp; Not, indeed,
to ancient times, for there was never a medi&aelig;val hostel
here, but to very old coaching days.&nbsp; Already, in 1776, when
the Rev. Thomas Twining was ambling about the country on
&ldquo;Poppet,&rdquo; making picturesque notes, it was a
&ldquo;gentlemanlike, comfortable house,&rdquo; and Sterne knew
it well.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am worn out,&rdquo; says he in one of his
letters, &ldquo;but press on to Barnby Moor
to-night.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even the &ldquo;worn-out&rdquo; would make
an effort, you see, to reach this hospitable roof-tree.</p>
<p>But a greater fame was earned by the &ldquo;Bell&rdquo; in its
later days, when it was kept by George Clark, at once innkeeper,
sportsman, and breeder of racehorses.&nbsp; He was famed for his
anecdotal and conversational powers, and when free from gout was
reputed &ldquo;a tough customer over the mahogany,&rdquo; in
which testimony we may read, in the manner of that time, a
crowning virtue.&nbsp; Something&mdash;nay, a great
deal&mdash;more than the &ldquo;red-nosed innkeepers&rdquo; of
whom Sir Walter Scott speaks, he was also a landed proprietor,
and supplied his extensive establishment from his own farm.&nbsp;
Peculiarly the man for this road, and especially for this portion
of the road, his personality made the &ldquo;Bell&rdquo;
inn&mdash;the word &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; was in those days an
abomination and an offence&mdash;the especial resort of the
sporting fraternity, and racing men generally contrived to make
his house their halting-place.</p>
<p>Clark reigned at the &ldquo;Bell&rdquo; for forty years, from
1800, dying of gout in 1842, shortly after he had sold the house
to a Mr. Inett.&nbsp; His was that famous mare, Lollypop, who
gave birth to the yet more famous Sweetmeat.&nbsp; But Clark did
not live to learn the quality of that foal, and Sweetmeat was
sold at the dispersal of his stable for ten guineas.&nbsp; Three
years later, when <a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>he had won the Somersetshire Stakes at Bath, Lord
George Bentinck in vain offered four thousand guineas for him,
and later in that year, 1845, he won the Doncaster Cup.</p>
<p>Clark was chiefly instrumental in bringing to justice two
incendiaries, disciples of &ldquo;Captain Swing,&rdquo; who had
fired a hayrick not far from the &ldquo;Bell.&rdquo;&nbsp; At
that period&mdash;the early &ldquo;thirties&rdquo;&mdash;when the
Reform agitation was embittering the relations between the
squires and the peasantry, rick-burnings were prevalent all over
the country.&nbsp; They went by the name of the &ldquo;Swing
Riots,&rdquo; from the circumstance of the threatening letters
and notices received being signed in the name of that entirely
pseudonymous or mythical person.&nbsp; One night Clark was roused
from his bed with the information that the rioters were at work
close at hand.&nbsp; Hastily rising and dressing by the glare of
his neighbour&rsquo;s burning ricks, he told off fifty from his
numerous staff of postboys and stable helpers to mount and to
thoroughly explore the country within a circuit of ten miles,
offering a reward of &pound;5 to the one who would discover the
miscreants, together with five shillings a head to all who took
part in the chase.&nbsp; It was a successful foray; for, before
morning dawned, two shivering &ldquo;rioters&rdquo; were brought
to him.&nbsp; They had been found hiding in a ditch.&nbsp;
Matches and other incriminating things were found on them, and,
being committed to York Castle, they eventually were awarded
fourteen years&rsquo; transportation.</p>
<p>The old &ldquo;Bell&rdquo; is still standing.&nbsp; A hundred
and twenty horses for the road were kept here in those old times,
but to-day, instead of horses, we have motor-cars.</p>
<p>Soon after railways had driven the coaches off the road, the
&ldquo;Bell&rdquo; ceased to be an inn.&nbsp; Its circumstances
were peculiar.&nbsp; Standing as it did, and still does, away
from any town or village, its only trade was with coaching or
posting travellers, and when they disappeared altogether there
was nothing for it but to close down.&nbsp; And so for sixty
years and <a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>more the &ldquo;Bell&rdquo; became a private residence,
and it would have remained so had not a road-enthusiast taken it
and re-opened the old house in 1906 as a hotel for touring
motorists.&nbsp; The enthusiast took other hotels on this
road.&nbsp; Took so many indeed that his resources as a private
person were overstrained, and he went bankrupt.&nbsp; But the
&ldquo;Bell,&rdquo; in this, its second time, flourishes
exceedingly.</p>

<p>From hence the bleak hamlets of Torworth and Ranskill lead to
Scrooby, set amidst the heathy vale of the winding Idle, which
sends its silver threads in aimless fashion amidst the
meadows.&nbsp; Here the road leaves Nottinghamshire and enters
Yorkshire.&nbsp; Beside the road at the little rise called
Scrooby Top, stands a farmhouse, once the old Scrooby Inn, kept
by Thomas Fisher as a kind of half-way house between Bawtry and
Barnby Moor, and calculated to intercept the posting business of
the &ldquo;Bell&rdquo; and of the Bawtry <a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>inns.&nbsp;
Competition was keen-edged on the roads in those times.</p>

<p>There seems to have once been a turnpike gate at Scrooby, for
a murder was committed there in 1779, when John Spencer, a
shepherd, calling up William Geadon, the turnpike man, one July
night under the pretence of having some cattle to go through,
knocked him down and killed him with a hedge-stake and then went
upstairs and murdered the turnpike man&rsquo;s mother.&nbsp;
Spencer was hanged at Nottingham, and gibbeted on the scene of
his crime.&nbsp; The stump of the gibbet was still visible in
1833.</p>
<p>This is the place whence came the chief among the
&ldquo;Pilgrim Fathers&rdquo; who at last, in 1620, succeeded in
leaving England in the <i>Mayflower</i>, for America.&nbsp;
Scrooby is the place of origin of that Separatist Church which
refused allegiance to the Church of England.&nbsp; Here lived
William Brewster, son of the bailiff of Scrooby Manor, once a
Palace of the Archbishops of York.&nbsp; In those times the Great
North Road wandered, as a lane, down through Scrooby village, and
all traffic went this way.&nbsp; William Brewster the elder,
bailiff and postmaster, was a government servant who kept relays
of horses primarily for the use of State messengers.&nbsp; His
salary was &ldquo;twenty pence a day&rdquo;; the equivalent of
about &pound;300 per annum of our money.&nbsp; Although very
definite regulations were laid down by the Board of Posts for the
conduct of this service, they were not strictly observed, and a
postmaster often traded for himself as well, keeping horses for
hire and being an innkeeper as well.</p>
<p>At any rate, the Brewsters were considerable people; and
William the elder could afford to send his son to Peterhouse,
Cambridge, and later had sufficient influence to secure him
service with one of Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s Secretaries of State
in Holland.&nbsp; But the Secretary fell into disgrace, and young
William&rsquo;s diplomatic career ended at an early age.</p>
<p>He returned home to Scrooby, where he found employment with
his father, and eventually succeeded <a name="page219"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 219</span>him, in 1594, holding the position
of postmaster for seventeen years.</p>
<p>Let us see, from one surviving record, what kind of business
was his, and how prosperous he must have been apart from his
official emoluments.&nbsp; One of his guests, as virtually an
innkeeper, was Sir Timothy Hutton, in 1605.&nbsp; Sir Timothy
paid him, for guide and conveyance to Tuxford, 10s., and for
candle, supper and breakfast 7s. 6d.&nbsp; On his return journey
he paid 8s. for horses to Doncaster, and a threepenny tip to the
ostler.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Brewster, nourished in that old nest of
Archbishops, had imbibed distinctly anti-episcopal ideas,
probably in Holland.&nbsp; His activities in founding the
Separatist Church led to his resignation of the
postmaster&rsquo;s office in 1607.&nbsp; In that old Manor House
where he lived assembled others of his ways of thought: the Revd.
Mr. Clifton, rector of Babworth, near Retford, William Bradford
of Austerfield, John Smyth, and other shining lights and painful
and austere persons.&nbsp; William Bradford records how the
congregation &ldquo;met ordinarily at William Brewster&rsquo;s
house on the Lord&rsquo;s Day; and with great love he entertained
them when they came, making provision for them, to his great
charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They would not attend services at the parish church; an
offence then punishable by fine and imprisonment, and thus,
persecuted, there was no ultimate course but to leave the
country: itself not for some time permitted.&nbsp; &ldquo;They
were,&rdquo; wrote William Bradford, &ldquo;hunted and persecuted
on every side.&nbsp; Some were taken and clapt up in prison,
others had their houses beset and watched, night and day, and
hardly escaped their hands; and the most were fain to fly and
leave their houses and habitations and the means of their
livelihood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Manor Farm, where these early developments of the Puritan
movement took place, and where the Brewsters lived, remains in
part, and bears an <a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>explanatory bronze tablet placed there by the Pilgrim
Society of Plymouth, Massachusetts.&nbsp; And there, too, near
the road, stands Scrooby church, rather dilapidated, with its
stone spire, much the same as ever.</p>

<p>Yorkshire, upon which we have now entered, is the largest
shire or county in England.&nbsp; In one way it seems almost
incredibly large, for it has more acres than there are letters
(not words) in the Bible.&nbsp; There are 3,882,851 acres in
Yorkshire, and 3,566,482 letters in the Bible.&nbsp; Yorkshire
does not reveal its full beauty to the traveller along this
road.&nbsp; Its abbeys and waterfalls, its river-gorges and
romantic valleys, belong rather to the by-ways.&nbsp;
Picturesqueness and romance spelt discomfort, and the uneventful
road was the one the travellers of old preferred.&nbsp; Thus it
is that those <a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>who pursue this route to the North, and know nothing
else of Yorkshire, might deny this huge county, more than twice
the size of Lincolnshire, the next largest, that variety and
beauty which, in fact, we know it to possess.&nbsp; For eighty
miles the Great North Road goes through Yorkshire with scarce a
hill worthy the name, although towards the north the Hambleton
Hills, away to the east, give the views from the road a sullen
grandeur.</p>
<p>But if the highway and the scenery bordering it are
characterless, this is a region of strongly marked character, so
far as its inhabitants are concerned.&nbsp; Many wits have been
to work on the Yorkshireman&rsquo;s peculiarities.&nbsp; While
they all agree to disregard his hospitality and his frank
heartiness, they unite to satirise his shrewdness, and his
clannish ways.&nbsp; The old Yorkshire toast is
famous:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s tiv us, all on us, me
an&rsquo; all.<br />
May we niver want nowt, noan on us,<br />
Nor me nawther.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this other:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Our Native County: t&rsquo;biggest,<br />
t&rsquo;bonniest, and t&rsquo;best.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The character of John Browdie is a very accurate exemplar of
the Yorkshire yeoman, and you could not wish to meet a better
fellow, but you would rather not have any dealings with the
Yorkshireman of popular imagination, whose native wit goes beyond
shrewdness and does not halt on the hither side of sharp
practice.&nbsp; The Yorkshireman&rsquo;s armorial bearings are
wickedly said to be a flea, a fly, and a flitch of bacon; because
a flea will suck any one&rsquo;s blood, like a Yorkshireman; a
fly will drink out of any one&rsquo;s cup, and so will a
Yorkshireman; and a flitch of bacon is no good until it is hung,
and no more is a Yorkshireman!&nbsp; No native of the county can
be expected to subscribe to this, but no one ever heard of a
Yorkshireman objecting to be called a &ldquo;tyke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A &ldquo;Yorkshire tyke&rdquo; is a familiar phrase.&nbsp; By
it we understand a native of this immense shire to be
named.&nbsp; No one knows whence this nickname arose, <a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>or whether
it is complimentary or the reverse.&nbsp; To be sure, we call a
dog a &ldquo;tyke,&rdquo; and to describe any one as a dog is not
complimentary, unless qualifications are made.&nbsp; Thus, the
man who is insulted by being called a dog rather takes it as a
compliment to be dubbed a &ldquo;sad dog&rdquo; or a &ldquo;sly
dog,&rdquo; and, like Bob Acres, lets you know, with a twinkle of
the eye, that on occasion he can be a &ldquo;devil of a
fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By common consent, whatever its origin may have been,
&ldquo;tyke,&rdquo; applied to a Yorkshireman, is taken in the
complimentary sense.&nbsp; Indeed, the Yorkshireman&rsquo;s good
conceit of himself does not allow him to think that any other
sense could possibly be intended.&nbsp; He generally prides
himself, like Major Bagstock, on being &ldquo;sly, devilish
sly.&rdquo;&nbsp; That he is so, too, those who have tried to
overreach him, either in his native wilds or elsewhere, have
generally discovered.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a deep
&rsquo;un,&rdquo; says a character in one of Charles
Reade&rsquo;s novels, &ldquo;but we are Yorkshire too, as the
saying is.&rdquo;&nbsp; When tyke meets tyke, then, if ever,
comes the tug of war.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Yorkshire,&rdquo;
is a saying which implies much, as in the story of the ostler
from the county who had long been in service at a London
inn.&nbsp; &ldquo;How is it,&rdquo; asked a guest, &ldquo;that
such a clever fellow as you, and a Yorkshireman, remains so long
without becoming master of the house?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Measter&rsquo;s Yorkshire too,&rdquo; answered the
servant.</p>
<p>It is a sporting&mdash;more especially a
horsey&mdash;county.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shake a bridle over a
Yorkshireman&rsquo;s grave, and he will rise and steal a
horse,&rdquo; is a proverb which bears a sort of testimony to the
fact.</p>
<h2>XXXIII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Yorkshire</span> and Yorkshiremen, their
virtues and vices, bring us to Bawtry, where the High Sheriff and
those in authority used to welcome kingly and queenly visitors to
Yorkshire, or escort them over the border, <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>on leaving;
performing the latter office with the better heart, there can be
little doubt, for royal progresses often left a trail of blood
and ruin behind them in those &ldquo;good&rdquo; old times.&nbsp;
Happy Bawtry! for little or no history attaches to the little
town, and it lives in the memory only as the home of that saddler
who, although famous as a proverb, has come down to us a nameless
martyr to the Temperance Cause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The saddler of Bawtry was hanged for leaving his
ale,&rdquo; runs the Yorkshire saying; one eminently
characteristic of this county of stingo and plurality of
acres.&nbsp; The history of this particular saddler, or the crime
for which he was condemned, are unknown either here or at York,
but his end is a terrible warning to all Blue Ribbonites.&nbsp;
It was in this wise that the artificer in pigskin lost his
life.&nbsp; Led forth to the fatal tree, the procession halted on
the way to present the condemned with the customary parting bowl
of ale, an institution on the way to the gallows both in York and
London.&nbsp; But the saddler would take none of their farewell
courtesies, and refused the drink; whereupon the enraged mob
strung him up, double quick.&nbsp; A few minutes later a reprieve
arrived, and they cut him down; but he was already dead, a
melancholy warning to all future generations of non-convivial
souls.</p>
<p>Coaching days made Bawtry a busy townlet, for although the
coaches and the postmasters generally made a long stage of
fourteen miles between Doncaster and Barnby Moor, or else a nine
and a half mile stage between Doncaster and Scrooby Top, the
by-roads gave a good proportion of business to the
&ldquo;Angel&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Crown.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Crown&rdquo; is still a prominent feature of
Bawtry&rsquo;s now empty street, a street whose width is a
revelation of the space once considered necessary and now
altogether superfluous; just as the long pillared range of
stableyards beyond the old coach archway of the inn itself has
now become.</p>
<p>Bawtry to-day is a great emptiness.&nbsp; Four-square
red-brick houses of a certain modishness, being indeed <a
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>built on
the model of town houses, look across the void roadway, with a
kind of patronising air, upon the peaked, timbered, or
lath-and-plaster gabled cottages that border the opposite side of
the street.&nbsp; Much older they are, those old cottages, and
more akin to the country.&nbsp; They were built long centuries
before the coaching age came, bringing a greater prosperity and
consequent expansion to Bawtry, and for a time they were quite
put out of countenance by the new-fangled brick houses, with
their classic porticoes and brass knockers and impudent red
faces.&nbsp; But a period of eighty or ninety years, at the most,
saw the beginning and the end of this expansion, and this once
fashionable air has altered to an aspect of old-world
dignity.&nbsp; Both the gabled cottages and these Georgian houses
would feel greatly degraded if confronted with examples of the
way in which the small country builder runs up his tasteless
structures nowadays, but happily Bawtry has nothing of this type
to show, and the white stuccoed elevation of the
&ldquo;Crown&rdquo; alone hints at a later phase in building
fashion, typifying the dawn of the nineteenth century <a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>and the
course of taste in its earlier years.&nbsp; This white-painted
frontage marks the close of Bawtry&rsquo;s busy days.&nbsp; Soon
afterwards the place ceased to live a pulsing everyday life of
business and activity, and began to merely exist.&nbsp; There are
shops here&mdash;old bow-windowed, many-paned shops&mdash;which
have long seen their best days go by.&nbsp; They came into
existence under the influence of the beatific Law of Demand and
Supply, when all the inns were full of travellers who wanted the
thousand and one necessities of civilisation.&nbsp; They did a
brave trade in those times, and continued it until the railway
snuffed it out in 1842.&nbsp; Since then no one has come to buy,
and their stock must contain many curiosities.&nbsp; Probably the
stationer has still some of that goffered and perfumed pink
notepaper on which the young ladies of sensibility wrote their
love-letters in the long-ago, together with a goodly supply of
the wafers with which they were sealed; and, doubtless, those who
seek could find flint and steel and tinder-boxes elsewhere.&nbsp;
Bawtry, in fine, is a monument to the Has Been.</p>

<p>Austerfield, where William Bradford was born in 1580, is a
grim and unlovely village to the left of Bawtry.&nbsp; Here yet
stands his birthplace, in its time a manor-house, but now
occupied as two cottage-dwellings, it is not a romantic-looking
relic to be the place of origin of one who became the first
Governor of the Pilgrim colony in New England.</p>
<p>There was once a pond beside the road near Bawtry (where is it
now, alas!) to which a history belonged, for into it used to
drive the villainous postboys of lang syne, who were in the pay
of the highwaymen.&nbsp; They would, as though by accident, whip
suddenly into it, and when the occupants of the chaise let down
the windows and looked out, to see what was the matter, they were
confronted with the grinning muzzle of a pistol, and the dread
alternative demand for their money or their lives.</p>
<p>Past this dread spot, and over the rise and dip in the road on
leaving the town, the galloping stage <a name="page226"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 226</span>is reached, a dead level by the
palings of Rossington Park and on to Rossington Bridge, where the
tollgate was, and now is not.&nbsp; The inn too, has, like many
another, taken down its sign, and retired into private
occupation.&nbsp; Off to the left is Rossington village, and in
the churchyard, the grave, for those who like to turn aside to
see it, of Charles Bosvile, &ldquo;King of the
Gipsies.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here we are four miles and a half from
Doncaster, or, as a Yorkshireman would say, four miles &ldquo;and
a way-bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ask a Yorkshireman how far it is to any place along the road,
and he will most likely answer you, so many miles &ldquo;and a
way-bit.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is probably his pronunciation of
&ldquo;wee bit.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is often said that the
&ldquo;way-bit&rdquo; is generally as long as the rest put
together.&nbsp; This expression compares with the Scottish so
many miles &ldquo;and a bittock.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>XXXIV</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">From</span> Rossington Bridge, a long pale
rise, bordered by coppices of hazels and silver birches, leads
past Cantley to Tophall, where one of the old road wagons was
struck by lightning on the 22nd of May 1800.&nbsp; One of the
seven horses drawing the wagon was killed, and four others were
stunned; while the great lumbering conveyance and its load of
woollen cloths, muslins, cottons, rabbit-down and a piano were
almost entirely burnt.&nbsp; The disaster was a long-remembered
event for miles round, and one of the Doncaster inns was renamed
from it, the &ldquo;Burning Waggon.&rdquo;&nbsp; This house has
long since been renamed the &ldquo;Ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passing Tophall, and by a bridge over the railway cutting,
Doncaster is seen, with its great church-tower, smoking
chimney-stalks, and puffing locomotives, map-like, down below,
three miles away.&nbsp; Two miles further, past Hawbush, or
Lousybush, Green, on which unaristocratically named spot <a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>old-time
tramps used to congregate, Doncaster racecourse is reached, on
the old Town Moor.</p>
<p>Doncaster, all England over, stands for racing and the St.
Leger, just as much as Epsom for the Derby, and racing has been
in progress here certainly ever since 1600, and perhaps even
before.&nbsp; The renowned St. Leger, which still draws its
hundreds of thousands every September, was established in 1778
and named by the Marquis of Rockingham after Lieut.-Colonel Ashby
St. Leger.&nbsp; All Yorkshire, and a large proportion of other
shires, flocks to witness this classic race, greatly to the
benefit of the town, which owns the racecourse and derives the
handsome income of some &pound;30,000 per annum from it.&nbsp;
Doncaster, indeed, does exceedingly well out of racing, and the
Town Council can well afford the &pound;380 annually expended in
stakes.&nbsp; But the St. Leger week is a terrible time for quiet
folks, for all the brazen-throated blackguards of the Three
Kingdoms are then let loose upon the town, and not even this sum
of &pound;30,000 in relief of the rates quite repays them for the
infliction.</p>
<p>Robert Ridsdale, originally &ldquo;Boots&rdquo; at a Doncaster
inn, rose to be owner of Merton Hall, about 1830.&nbsp; He was a
bookmaker.&nbsp; Betting is a pursuit in which only the
bookmakers secure the fortunes.</p>
<p>Dickens, who was here during the St. Leger week in 1857, in
company with Wilkie Collins, and stayed at the still extant
&ldquo;Angel,&rdquo; saw this side of horse-racing fully
displayed.&nbsp; Looking down into the High Street from their
window, the friends saw &ldquo;a gathering of blackguards from
all parts of the racing earth.&nbsp; Every bad face that had ever
caught wickedness from an innocent horse had its representation
in the streets,&rdquo; and the next day after the great race
every chemist&rsquo;s shop in the town was full of penitent
bacchanalians of the night before, roaring to the busy dispensers
to &ldquo;Give us soom sal-volatile or soom damned thing o&rsquo;
that soort, in wather&mdash;my head&rsquo;s bad!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Night was made hideous for all who sojourned at the
&ldquo;Angel&rdquo; by the &ldquo;groaning phantom&rdquo; that
lay in the doorway <a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span>of one of the bedrooms and howled until the morning,
like a lost soul; explanation by the landlord in the morning
eliciting the fact that the fearsome sounds were caused by a
gentleman who had lost &pound;1,500 or &pound;2,000 by backing a
&ldquo;wrong &rsquo;un,&rdquo; and had accordingly drank himself
into a <i>delirium tremens</i>.</p>
<p>Sir William Maxwell of Menreith, who won the St. Leger with
Filho da Puta, in 1815, celebrated his success by thrusting his
walking-stick through all the pier-glasses at the
&ldquo;Reindeer&rdquo;; expressing his regret that there were no
more to smash, as an adequate relief to his feelings.</p>
<p>Dean Pigou, once vicar of Doncaster, bears later testimony to
the character of a large proportion of the race-crowds, and tells
amusingly how the contingents of pickpockets who flock here on
these occasions disguise themselves as clergymen, a fact well
known to the police, and resulting in the arrest of a genuine
cleric on one occasion.&nbsp; &ldquo;You old rascal!&rdquo; said
the constable; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve been looking for you for a long
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doncaster, out of the season, is a singularly quiet and
inoffensive town, and looks as innocent as its native
butterscotch.&nbsp; Quiet, because the locomotive and
carriage-works of the Great Northern Railway are a little way
outside; inoffensive, because it is unpretending.&nbsp; At the
same time it is just as singularly devoid of interest.&nbsp;
Almost its oldest houses are those on Hall Cross Hill, as the
traveller passes the elm-avenue by the racecourse and enters the
town from the direction of London; and they are scarce older than
the days of the Prince Regent.&nbsp; Very like the older part of
Brighton, this southern end of Doncaster is the best the town has
to show.</p>
<p>Hall Cross&mdash;originally called &ldquo;Hob
Cross&rdquo;&mdash;was destroyed in the seventeenth-century
troubles.&nbsp; It was a late Norman structure, and is copied in
the existing Cross, set up by the Corporation, as an inscription
informs the passer-by, in 1793.&nbsp; A weird structure it is,
too, consisting of a stone pillar of five <a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>engaged
shafts, reflecting credit on neither the original designer nor
the restorers.&nbsp; But there it stands, elevated above the
modern road, as evidence of a momentary aberration in favour of
restoring antiquity of which the Corporation were guilty, a
century or so ago.&nbsp; Doncastrians have purged themselves so
thoroughly of that weakness in later years that they have left no
other vestige of old times in their streets.&nbsp; The finest
example of an old inn belonging to the town was destroyed in the
pulling down of the &ldquo;Old Angel&rdquo; in 1846, in order to
clear a site for the Guildhall.&nbsp; Others are left, but, if
old-fashioned, they are scarcely picturesque: the
&ldquo;Angel,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ram,&rdquo; &ldquo;Elephant,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Salutation,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Old George.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>In old newspaper files we find Richard Wood, of the
&ldquo;Reindeer&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ram&rdquo; inns, High Street,
advertising that his coaches were the best&mdash;&ldquo;the
horses keep good time&mdash;<i>no</i> racing&rdquo;; from which
we conclude that there <i>had</i> been some.&nbsp; It was Richard
Wood, then the foremost coach-proprietor in Doncaster, who first
gave employment to that celebrated painter of horses and coaches,
John Frederick Herring, who, although a Londoner born, lived long
and worked much at Doncaster.&nbsp; It was in 1814, when in his
nineteenth year, that he first came to the town, the love of
horses bringing him all the way.&nbsp; Seeing the &ldquo;Royal
Union&rdquo; starting at eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning with
&ldquo;Doncaster&rdquo; displayed in large letters on its panels,
on the inspiration of the moment he took a seat, and arrived in
time to witness the horse &ldquo;William&rdquo; win the St.
Leger.</p>
<p>There is a tale of his observing a man clumsily trying to
paint a picture of the Duke of Wellington, seated on his charger,
for the panel of a coach to be called after that hero of a
hundred fights.&nbsp; He had, somehow, managed to worry through
the figure of the Duke, and to secure a recognisable likeness of
him&mdash;because, for this purpose, all that was necessary was
the representation of an ascetic face and a large, beak-like
nose&mdash;but he boggled at the horse.&nbsp; Herring <a
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>offered to
paint in the horse for him, and did it so well that he earned the
thanks of the proprietor, who happened to appear on the scene and
commissioned him to paint the insignia of the &ldquo;Royal
Forester,&rdquo; Doncaster and Nottingham coach; a white lion on
one door and a reindeer on the other.&nbsp; These he performed
with equal credit, and taking a seat beside the proprietor in
question, who, with others, mounted for a ride to
&ldquo;prove&rdquo; the springs and christen the new coach, he at
once offered himself as coachman.&nbsp; Mr. Wood, for it was he,
was naturally surprised at the idea of a painter driving a coach,
but consented to give him a trial the next day on the
&ldquo;Highflyer,&rdquo; and to abide by the decision of the
regular driver of that famous drag.&nbsp; The result was
favourable, and Herring obtained the box-seat, not of the
&ldquo;Royal Forester,&rdquo; but of the &ldquo;Nelson,&rdquo;
Wakefield and Lincoln coach.&nbsp; He was, after two years,
transferred to the Doncaster and Halifax road, and thence
promoted to the &ldquo;Highflyer,&rdquo; painting in his leisure
hours many of the signs of Doncaster&rsquo;s old inns.&nbsp; It
was when on this road that he attracted the attention of a local
gentleman, who obtained him a commission for a picture which laid
the foundation of his success.</p>
<p>Nearly all the local signs that Herring painted have
disappeared.&nbsp; Some were taken down when he became famous,
and added to private collections of pictures; while others were
renewed from the effects of time and weather by being painted
over by journeyman painters.&nbsp; Some landlords, however, knew
the value of these signs well enough.&nbsp; There was, for
instance, mine host of the &ldquo;Doncaster Arms,&rdquo; who,
having come from cow-keeping to the inn-keeping business,
determined to change the name of the house to the &ldquo;Brown
Cow.&rdquo;&nbsp; He induced Herring to paint the new sign, which
immediately attracted attention.&nbsp; According to one story, a
gentleman posting north chanced to see it and stopped the postboy
while he endeavoured to drive a bargain for the purchase.&nbsp;
He offered twice as much as mine host had originally paid; ten
times as much, <a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>but without avail.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not for twenty
times,&rdquo; said that licensed victualler; and the connoisseur
went without it.</p>
<p>The other version makes the traveller a very important man,
travelling with four post-horses, and represents the landlord as
being away, and the landlady as the obstinate holder.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;s rare and glad, measter, my husband&rsquo;s not
at home,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps
he&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; let thee hae it; but I wain&rsquo;t; for
what it&rsquo;s worth to thee it&rsquo;s worth to me, so gang
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A list has been preserved of the signs painted by Herring at
Doncaster, but they will be sought in vain to-day.&nbsp; They
were&mdash;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Labour in Vain&rdquo; represented the fruitless
labour of attempting to wash a black man white.</p>
<p>The old sign of the &ldquo;Salutation,&rdquo; painted by a
Dutchman in 1766, was touched up by Herring.&nbsp; Many years ago
it was removed, but has now been replaced, and may be seen on the
front of the house in Hall Cross.&nbsp; It is much weather-worn,
and represents, in dim and uncertain fashion, two clumsy looking
old gentlemen in the costume of a hundred and forty years ago,
rheumatically saluting one another.&nbsp; The sign of the
&ldquo;Stag,&rdquo; painted on plaster still remains, in a
decaying condition.</p>
<p>Herring continued as a coachman for several years, and only
left the box in 1830, when he went to reside in London.&nbsp;
From that date until his death in 1865 he devoted himself
entirely to painting.</p>
<p>Richard Wood, Herring&rsquo;s first employer, was
part-proprietor of the &ldquo;Lord Nelson&rdquo; coach, among
others.&nbsp; Especial mention must be made of this particular <a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>conveyance,
because if not the first, it must have been one of the earliest,
of the coaches by which passengers were allowed to book through
to or from London, and to break their journey where they
pleased.&nbsp; To those who could not endure the long agonies of
a winter&rsquo;s journey except in small doses, this arrangement
must have been a great boon.&nbsp; To this coach belongs the
story of a Frenchman, still preserved by Doncaster gossips.</p>
<p>It was in the early part of the century that he wanted to
travel from &ldquo;Doncastare&rdquo; to London.&nbsp; Inquiring
at the booking-office for the best coach, the clerk mentioned the
&ldquo;Lord Nelson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn your Lord Nelson!&rdquo; says the Frenchman in a
rage.&nbsp; &ldquo;What others are there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The names of the others heaped greater offence upon him, for
they were the &ldquo;Waterloo&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Duke of
Wellington.&rdquo;&nbsp; So perhaps he posted instead, and saved
his national susceptibilities at the expense of his pocket.</p>
<p>Another, and a later, coach-proprietor and innkeeper at
Doncaster was Thomas Pye, of the &ldquo;Angel.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
lived to see railways ruin the coaching business, but he kept the
&ldquo;Angel&rdquo; for years afterwards, and his family after
him.&nbsp; The Queen, on her way to Scotland in 1861, slept there
one night, and the loyal family promptly added the title of
&ldquo;Royal&rdquo; to the old house.</p>
<p>Coaching days were doomed at Doncaster in 1859, when the
Midland Railway was opened and diverted the traffic; and nine
years later, when the Great Northern Railway came, the last coach
was withdrawn.</p>
<p>Few think of Doncaster as a centre of spiritual
activity.&nbsp; Racing seems to comprehend everything, and to
make it, like a famous winner of the St. Leger a case of
&ldquo;Eclipse first; the rest nowhere!&rdquo;&nbsp; Even
Doncaster butterscotch is more familiar than Doncaster piety, but
the Church is particularly active here, nevertheless.&nbsp; That
activity only dates from the appointment of Dr. Vaughan as vicar,
in 1859.&nbsp; Before his time religion was very dead, so that,
when the <a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
235</span>great parish church of St. George was burnt down in
1853, the then vicar, Dr. Sharpe, on seeing the flames burst out,
could at first only think of his false teeth, which he had left
in the building, and exclaimed in horror-stricken tones,
&ldquo;Good gracious! and I have left my set of teeth in the
vestry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The church was rebuilt by Sir Gilbert Scott.&nbsp; It is a
magnificent building, but too palpably Scott, and the details of
the carving painfully mechanical.&nbsp; Also, the stone was so
badly selected that the crockets and enrichments were long ago
found to be decaying, and &ldquo;restoration&rdquo; of a building
not then fifty years old was found necessary.</p>
<p>Dr. Vaughan was a bitter opponent of horse-racing, and so was
not popular with the sporting element; and as Doncaster is, above
everything, given over to sport, this meant that his nine
years&rsquo; vicariate was a sojourn in a hostile camp.&nbsp; His
predecessors had been more complaisant.&nbsp; Always within
living memory the church bells had been rung on the St. Leger
day, and generally at the moment the winning horse had passed the
post.&nbsp; Dr. Vaughan put an end to this and quietly
inaugurated a new era, not by raising a dispute, but by obtaining
the keys of the belfry on the first St. Leger day of his
incumbency, and, locking the door, going for a walk which kept
him out of the town until the evening!</p>
<h2>XXXV</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Leaving</span> Doncaster and its racing
and coaching memories behind, we come out upon the open road
again by Frenchgate, past the unprepossessing
&ldquo;Volunteer&rdquo; inn, in whose yard Mendoza and Humphries
brought off their prize-fight in 1790; past Marshgate and over
the dirty Don to a parting of the ways.&nbsp; To the left goes
the Ferrybridge, Wetherby, and Boroughbridge route to the North;
to the right, that by way of Selby and York.&nbsp; Both fall into
one <a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
236</span>again at Northallerton; both claim to be the true Great
North Road; and both were largely travelled, so that we shall
have to pay attention to either.&nbsp; In the first instance, we
will go via York, the mail-route in later coaching days, and as
flat and uninteresting a road, so far as the cathedral city, as
it is possible to imagine.&nbsp; Beginning with the suburban
village of Bentley, with its ugly new cottages and handsome new
church, it continues, with ruts and loose stones as its chief
features, to Askerne, passing through lonely woods and past pools
and lakes, with a stray grouse or so, and astonished hares and
rabbits, as the sole witnesses of the explorer&rsquo;s progress
in these deserted ways.&nbsp; Off to the right-hand, two miles or
so away, goes the Great Northern Railway, one of the causes of
this solitude, to meet the North Eastern at Shaftholme Junction,
where, as the chairman said, many years ago, the Great Northern
ends, ingloriously, &ldquo;in a ploughed field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Askerne, in a situation of great natural beauty, amidst
limestone rocks and lakes, and with the advantage of possessing
medicinal springs, has been, like most Yorkshire villages, made
hideous by its houses and cottages, inconceivably ugly to those
who have not seen what abominable places Yorkshire folk are
capable of building and living in.&nbsp; Askerne&rsquo;s fame as
what its inhabitants call a &ldquo;spawing place&rdquo; has not
spread of late, but its old pump-room and its lake are the
resorts of York and Doncaster&rsquo;s trippers in summer-time,
and those holiday-makers derive just as much health from rowing
in pleasure-boats on the lake as did their forefathers, who, a
hundred years ago, quaffed its evil-tasting sulphurous
waters.</p>
<p>Thus Askerne.&nbsp; Between it and Selby, a distance of
thirteen miles, the road and the country around are but parts of
a flat, watery, treeless, featureless plain, its negative
qualities tempered by the frankly mean and ugly villages on the
way, and criss-crossed by railways, sluggish rivers, and unlovely
canals.&nbsp; So utterly without interest is the road, that a
crude <a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>girder-bridge or a gaunt and forbidding flour-mill
remain vividly impressed upon the mental retina for lack of any
other outstanding objects.</p>

<img alt=
"Brayton Church"
title=
"Brayton Church"
 src="images/p237.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Nearing Selby, the octagonal Perpendicular lantern and spire
of Brayton church, curiously imposed upon a Norman tower,
attracts attention as much by the relief they give from the
deadly dulness just encountered as for their own sake; although
they are beautiful and interesting, the lantern having been
designed to hold a cresset beacon by which the travellers of the
Middle Ages were guided at night across the perilous waste; the
spire serving the same office by day.&nbsp; Here, too, the
isolated hills of Brayton Burf and Hambleton Hough, three miles
away, show prominently, less by reason of their height, which is
inconsiderable, than on account of the surrounding levels, which
give importance to the slightest rise.</p>
<p>Brayton, which, apart from its beautiful church, is about as
miserable a hole as it is possible to find in all Yorkshire (and
that is saying a good deal), is a kind of outpost between Selby
and these wilds, standing a mile and a half in advance of the
town.&nbsp; <a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
238</span>In that mile and a half the builders are busy erecting
a flagrant suburb, so that the traveller presses on, curious to
witness the prosperity of Selby itself, arguable from these
signs.&nbsp; Even without them, Selby is approached with
expectancy, for its abbey is famous, and abbeys imply picturesque
towns.</p>
<p>From this point of view Selby is distinctly
disappointing.&nbsp; The glorious Abbey, now the parish church,
is all, and more than, one expects, and the superlatively
cobble-stoned Market-place, painful to walk in, is picturesque to
look at; but the rest is an effect of meanness.&nbsp; Mean old
houses of no great age; mean new ones; mean and threadbare
waterside industries; second-hand clothes-shops, coal-grit, muddy
waters and foreshores of the slimy Ouse, shabby rope-walks, and
dirty alleys: these are Selby.</p>
<p>You forget all this before that beautiful Abbey, whose
imposing west front faces the Market-place, and whose great
length is revealed only by degrees.&nbsp; Alike in size and
beauty, it shows itself in a long crescendo to the admiring
amateur of architecture, who proceeds from the combined
loveliness of the Norman, Early English, and Perpendicular west
front, to the entrance by the grand Transitional Norman-Early
English north porch, thence to the solemn majesty of the purely
Norman nave, ending with the light and graceful Decorated choir
and Lady Chapel.&nbsp; The upper stage of the tower fell in 1690,
and destroyed the south transept.</p>
<p>A very destructive fire occurred in October 1906, and
opportunity was afterwards taken of doing a good deal of general
restoration.</p>
<p>Before leaving the town of Selby, let us look at the
commonplace little square called Church Hill.&nbsp; A
spirit-level might reveal it to be an eminence of twelve inches
or so above the common level of Selby, but to the evidence of
eyes or feet it is in no way distinguished from its neighbouring
streets.&nbsp; Yet it must have presented the appearance of a
hillock when the original founder of the Abbey came here in 1068,
voyaging up <a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>the Ouse and landing at this first likely place on its
then lovely banks.&nbsp; This founder was a certain Benedict, a
monk of Auxerre, who, having one of those convenient dreams which
came to the pious ones of that time when they wanted to steal
something, made off with the Holy Finger of St. Germanus; rather
appropriate spoil, by the way, for the light-fingered
Benedict.&nbsp; Arriving in England, he met an Englishman who
gave him a golden reliquary.&nbsp; With this, he took ship from
Lyme Regis and sailed to the Humber and the Ouse; landing, as we
have seen, here, and planting a cross on the river bank, where he
erected a hut for himself under an oak-tree.&nbsp; A few days
later, Hugh, the Norman sheriff of Yorkshire, came up the Ouse,
by chance, and not, as might be supposed, to arrest Benedict on a
charge of petty larceny.&nbsp; He was impressed by the devoutness
of the holy man, and sent workmen to build the original wooden
place of worship at Selby, on the spot now known as Church Hill,
not a stone&rsquo;s throw from the existing Abbey.</p>

<p>Centuries passed.&nbsp; The first building was swept away, and
even the cemetery which afterwards occupied the site was
forgotten and built over, becoming a square of houses, among
which was the &ldquo;Crown&rdquo; inn.&nbsp; From 1798 until
1876, when it was rebuilt, the old &ldquo;Crown&rdquo; kept an
odd secret.&nbsp; To understand this, we must go back to 1798,
when the neighbourhood of Selby acquired an ill name for highway
robberies.&nbsp; Among other outrages, a mailbag was stolen from
the York postboy, on the evening of February 22 in that
year.&nbsp; The Postmaster of York reported the affair to the
Postmaster-General in the following terms:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to acquaint you that the postboy coming from
Selby to this city was robbed of his mail, between six and seven
o&rsquo;clock this evening.&nbsp; About three miles this side
Selby he was accosted by a man on foot with a gun in his hand,
who asked him if he was the postboy, and at the same time seizing
hold of the bridle.&nbsp; Without waiting for any answer, he told
the boy he must immediately <a name="page241"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 241</span>unstrap the mail and give it to him,
pointing the muzzle of the gun at him whilst he did it.&nbsp;
When he had given up the mail, the boy begged he would not hurt
him, to which the man replied, &ldquo;He need not be
afraid,&rdquo; and at the same time pulled the bridle from the
horse&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; The horse immediately galloped off with
the boy, who had never dismounted.&nbsp; He was a stout man,
dressed in a dark jacket, and had the appearance of a
heckler.&nbsp; The boy was too much frightened to make any other
remark upon his person, and says he was totally unknown to
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mail contained bags for Howden and London, Howden
and York, and Selby and York.&nbsp; I have informed the surveyors
of the robbery, and have forwarded handbills this night, to be
distributed in the country, and will take care to insert it in
the first paper published here.&nbsp; Waiting your further

<p>A reward of two hundred pounds was offered for the discovery
of the highwayman, but without effect, and the matter was
forgotten in the dusty archives of the G.P.O., until it was
brought to notice again by the singular discovery of one of the
stolen bags in the roof of the &ldquo;Crown&rdquo; when being
demolished in 1876.&nbsp; Stuffed in between the rafters and the
tiles, the workmen came upon a worn and rotten coat, a
&ldquo;sou&rsquo;wester&rdquo; hat, and a mail-bag marked
&ldquo;Selby.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus, nearly eighty years after the
affair, and when every one concerned in it must long since have
been no more, this incriminating evidence came to light.&nbsp;
The Postmaster-General of that time claimed the bag, and it was,
after some dispute about the ownership, handed over to him, and
is now in the Post Office Museum.</p>
<p>A number of skeletons were discovered in digging foundations
for the new inn, and it was darkly conjectured that the old house
had had its gruesome secrets, dating from the times when inns
were not infrequently the nests of murderers; until local
antiquaries pointing out that the name of the place was Church
Hill, and that this was an ancient <a name="page242"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 242</span>grave-yard, the excitement
ceased.&nbsp; This view was borne out by the fact that in many
cases the bodies had been enclosed in rude coffins, made of
hollowed tree-trunks; and it was rightly said that murderers
would not have buried their victims with so much
consideration.</p>
<h2>XXXVI</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">To</span> leave Selby for York, one must
needs cross the Ouse bridge, one of thee few places where tolls
still survive.&nbsp; Foot-passengers and cyclists are on an
equality, paying one penny each.</p>
<p>Level-crossings again have their wicked will of the road, and
are indeed its principal features, through Barlby and
Riccall.&nbsp; We need some modern Rebeccaites for the abolition
of these unpaid-for easements granted to the Railway Companies by
an indulgent legislature, composed largely of Railway Directors,
for the mingled danger and waste of public time caused by
level-crossings over public roads constitute a scandal urgently
in need of being removed.&nbsp; Yorkshire people might be
recommended to see to it, as their forefathers saw to the
abolition of turnpikes, collecting in armed and disguised bands
and wrecking and burning the obnoxious gates for great
distances.&nbsp; In May 1753 they assembled at Selby at the
summons of the public crier&rsquo;s bell, and proceeded at
midnight to demolish all the gates in that neighbourhood.&nbsp;
The military were called out to quell these Hampdens.&nbsp; They
did not succeed in saving the gates, but shot and captured a
number of the &ldquo;rioters,&rdquo; who were sent for trial to
York Castle.</p>
<p>Riccall, near the confluence of the Ouse and the Derwent,
looks an unlikely seaport in these times, now that those rivers
and the confluent Foss, a mile or so nearer York, flow soberly in
their channels and cease from spreading over the land.&nbsp;
Eight hundred years ago, however, things were very
different&mdash;as <a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>indeed they well might be in that tremendous space of
time.&nbsp; So different, in fact, that when the invasion of the
North, under Tostig and Harald Hardrada, took place in 1066,
before that greater invasion in the South by William &ldquo;the
Conqueror,&rdquo; whose success has overshadowed these
operations, the invaders&rsquo; fleet sailed up the Humber and
the Ouse and blockaded the waterways by anchoring at
Riccall.&nbsp; From this base they advanced, defeating Earl
Morcar at the battle of Fulford, and seized York; retiring on the
approach of English Harold to what the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle
calls &ldquo;Staenfordesbryege,&rdquo; on Derwent, east of the
city.&nbsp; In this we find the original spelling of Stamford
Bridge, where the great battle which ended in the utter defeat of
the invaders was fought and their leaders, Tostig and the
gigantic Norwegian king, both slain.&nbsp; A fortnight later, and
the Duke of Normandy had landed at Pevensey, the battle of
Hastings had been lost and won, and the victor of Stamford Bridge
himself lay dead.</p>
<p>Riccall, and the country between it and York, should therefore
be interesting, as the scene of the earlier of these
invasions.&nbsp; Aside from the village flows the Ouse, deep in
its channel and navigable for barges, than which the Norwegian
ships were not much larger; but it could not in these days
harbour a fleet, even of these primitive transports.&nbsp; The
village itself bears nothing on its face telling of great events,
and is of a placid dulness, a character shared by Escrick and
Deighton, on the way to York; the road itself gradually becoming
an abomination of desolate fields until the village of Gate
Fulford is reached.&nbsp; The Great North Road is a businesslike
highway.&nbsp; It goes as direct as may be to its destination,
and gets there quite regardless of scenery or interest to right
or left.&nbsp; Thus, although Escrick Park is reputed to be a
demesne of great beauty, and the village of Naburn, lying hidden
off the road, is a typical old English village actually boasting
a maypole, all the traveller along the road perceives is an
unromantic vista of cabbage-fields and other <a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>necessary
but uninspiring domestic vegetables, through a haze of a
particularly beastly kind of black dust peculiar to the last few
miles of the way into York.&nbsp; Fulford itself is no fit herald
of a cathedral city.&nbsp; A wide street, the terminus of a
tramway, a mile-long row of cottages, a would-be Gothic church;
here you have it.&nbsp; Before you, by degrees, York unfolds
itself, past the military barracks and nondescript, but always
disappointing, streets, until, emerging from Fishergate, the
ancient city, free from suburban excrescences, opens out, with
the grim castle in front, and the Ouse and Skeldergate Bridge to
the left.&nbsp; The so-called &ldquo;London Road&rdquo; lies away
beyond the Ouse, its name referring to the Doncaster,
Ferrybridge, Sherburn, and Tadcaster route taken by some of the
old-time coaches.&nbsp; By that route York is most romantically
entered, across Knavesmire, where York&rsquo;s martyrs, felons,
and traitors were done to death in the old days, and where the
racecourse now runs; coming to the walled city through
Micklegate, the finest of all the medi&aelig;val defensible
gateways which are York&rsquo;s especial glory.&nbsp; By the
Selby route, through Gate Fulford and along Fishergate, we seem
to slink in by the back door; through Micklegate we follow in the
steps of those who have marched with armed hosts at their heels,
and have entered with the unquestioned right of conquerors.&nbsp;
Thus came the young Duke of York at the head of his victorious
army, after the crowning victory of Towton; the first thing to
meet his gaze his father&rsquo;s head, fixed on the topmost
turret, and crowned in mockery with a paper crown by the fierce
Lancastrians under whose swords he had fallen at the battle of
Wakefield, three months before.&nbsp; Filial piety could not in
those times rest content with removing the head from its shameful
eminence, and so the Duke caused the Earl of Devon and three
others among his prisoners to be immediately beheaded and their
heads to be placed there instead.&nbsp; Of such, and still more
sanguinary, incidents is the ancient city of York composed.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
